can try full library meditations every situation. Today,
going continue discussion hormones going focus
particular hormones influence energy levels immune system. Now, last
episode mentioned end concluding month hormones,
decide include additional episodes, fifth episode
sequence episodes hormones. two hormones
vitally important huge number biological functions will talk today,
particularly important energy levels immune system.
something get asked lot. rather skip next general topic,
today going talk hormones cortisol epinephrine also called
adrenaline. not heard previous episodes hormones order


understand digest material today's podcast. mentioned anything
related previous episodes, promise give little bit quick background get
everyone speed. Today, going talk biology cortisol.
going talk biology epinephrine. always talk mechanism
going lot tools. somebody struggles stress energy
levels, balancing stress energy levels, today's episode going vital
you. somebody challenges sleep somebody
challenges getting energy level throughout day, getting energy
level want sleep today's episode also you. going
talk immune system enhance function immune system.
also going get fun topics related learning memory
can leverage cortisol epinephrine particular, order learn faster.
going talk so-called nootropics, smart drugs work,
several tap epinephrine system aren't often discussed
access to. going talk caffeine can actually rewire
brain better worse. going talk biology comfort
foods work well, doing. understanding
able better understand food choices relate short-term
long-term energy. lot cover, everything will timestamped. want
just remind people caption every episode English Spanish.
captions take day two pop YouTube. not seeing within
first couple days, please patient us, order get captions actually
read similarly saying. go captioning service,
done experts takes little bit additional time. Meanwhile
questions episode evolves please write down. Please put
comment section. Please subscribe channel haven't already, get
started talking increase energy,

00:08:34 & Intermittent Fasting Increases Growth Hormone

improve increase immunity leveraging biology cortisol
adrenaline. dive biology increasing energy immune
system, want cover three topics promised mention previous
episodes. first one relates intermittent fasting. second one relates


stomach grumbles. forgot mention biology last time. third
powerful way increase growth hormone, powerful increasing metabolism,
fat burning, tissue repair, et cetera. doesn't involve sauna wrapping
plastic bags going jog. first intermittent fasting. Last episode
talked lot growth hormone thyroid hormone, mentioned things like
sauna exercise, sleep, can increase levels growth hormone
within healthy ranges. increasing growth hormone can beneficial
can burn off body fat, can improve muscle general tissue health,
cartilage, et cetera. tend lose, levels growth hormone reduced
age. Many people asked me, "well, fasting?" Everyone's promised
internet intermittent fasting leads big increases growth hormone.
reason didn't mention couldn't find study actually pointed
underlying mechanism. saw lots claims, lots podcasts. Lots degrees behind
people's names, sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely different fields talking
this, studies. found consider study. will link
study. Turns fasting increase growth hormone levels way
fascinating. mentioned previous podcast hunger timing
meals timing hunger, hungry release hormone
body called ghrelin, sometimes actually called ghrelin. Thanks ghrelinisters,
ghrelinisters corrected pronunciation, ghrelin ghrelin, either one
works. Ghrelin makes hungry, blood glucose, blood sugar low, ghrelin
secreted makes hungry. turns ghrelin, hunger hormone
actually binds receptor brain normally binds called growth
hormone releasing hormone. believe not hunger hormone can act like growth
hormone releasing hormone thereby stimulate growth hormone. Now levels
growth hormone fasting promotes ghrelin system pretty substantial.
doubling growth hormone levels waking state. know
can release growth hormone sleep, intermittent fasting turns can increase
growth hormone binding ghrelin growth hormone, releasing hormone receptor
also daytime. yes indeed fasting can increase growth
hormone, not super levels taking growth hormone increase it,
sauna increase it, seem increase growth hormone. Later today's
episode going talk lot different patterns fasting eating can
control epinephrine. will turn specifics long fast. need


fast two three days, 23 hours? Fortunately people like love eat,

00:11:56 Stomach Growls

not case. talk specific fasting protocols later episode. also
said, going talk tummy grumble, stomach growls not
fluid sifting around there. lot people think, Oh, know fluid
sifting around. Turns stomach smooth muscle lines sides
eat something don't every stomach cinches off
two ends like bag hose either end, 'cause essentially
digestive system is. nothing happens muscles line
sides stomach kind extend around stomach cables,
always food stomach, churn
stomach. literally turn muscles stomach like tumbler help
break food presumably didn't chew well enough 'cause eating
fast. don't food stomach churning continues.
contraction muscle, turning, literally turning muscles
don't flip completely, turning muscles, causes
stomach growling. don't want person meeting, sitting
quiet theater whose stomach growling,

00:13:09 Hot Baths & Hormones

chew food better. simple solution. last episode, talked lot
sauna, controlled safe hyperthermia can cause huge increases growth hormone
release anywhere 300 500, even 1600% increases growth hormone release.
Really staggeringly high increases. pointed many people don't saunas
yard homes, go measures
increase safely body heat. know, creating steam room bathroom,
jogging extra sweats kind thing. Many asked hot baths, hot
bags will increase growth hormone, however temperatures need order
increase growth hormone high enough run risk burn. really
can't make recommendations hot bath, can tolerate nice hot bath
going get growth hormone release. However, sauna


advantage able enter 175 degree, 200 degree environment, provided
not pregnant, not young child, et cetera. can safely.
getting big increases growth hormone. hot bath will lead lesser increases
growth hormone. going talk lot temperature regulation future
episode, always ever going start playing hyperthermia
hypothermia, cold baths, ice baths, hot showers, hot baths beyond kind
norm comfortable, extremely careful

00:14:35 Energy, Adrenaline (Epinephrine), & Cortisol

please consult doctor. think fair say people like
lot energy day, work day. like energy
taper off night. think fair say people don't enjoy sick.
Nobody wants get sick. words, want energy, want
immune system function well, ward off infections various kinds, bacterial
infections, viral infections, et cetera. turns two hormones
dominate processes enough energy healthy immune
system cortisol epinephrine. Epinephrine thing adrenaline.
body tend call adrenaline adrenaline, brain tend call adrenaline
epinephrine. sorry didn't create naming system. story
behind uninteresting not worth time. will use words adrenaline
epinephrine interchangeably today. Cortisol cortisol. just want cover little bit
cortisol epinephrine are? released body
brain?

00:15:48 Cortisol & Cholesterol, Competition Testosterone & Estrogen

can understand will understand better control them. First
all, cortisol steroid hormone much like estrogen testosterone
derived cholesterol. Now cholesterol eat,
cholesterol produced liver. many probably know relationship
dietary cholesterol, fats eat blood cholesterol, liver
cholesterol controversial one. barbed wire topic. people
claim dietary cholesterol zero impact circulating cholesterol coming


liver, people argue exact opposite, good data hand
say. problems idea cholesterol levels
determined dietary intake. Namely, anorexics often high levels
cholesterol liver produces, even though eating little
sometimes not eating all. understand cholesterol precursor molecule,
meaning substrate lot things like testosterone estrogen
made. Please also understand cholesterol can made estrogen,
testosterone, cortisol. cortisol sort competitive partner estrogen
testosterone. means is, no matter much cholesterol eating
produce, whether not low high, stressed
cholesterol going devoted toward creating cortisol, indeed stress
hormone. However, word stress shouldn't stress out, need cortisol,
cortisol vital. don't want cortisol levels low. important
immune system function, memory, not getting depressed. just don't want
cortisol levels high don't want elevated even normal
levels wrong time day.

00:17:54 Adrenaline (Epinephrine) (Immune Systems) Best Friend

going talk control timing level cortisol. Epinephrine
adrenaline also demonized bit. think stress hormone,
thing makes us anxious, fight flight. know, used get chased lions
tigers, bears, now don't. ancient hangover, wrong.
fact matter epinephrine best friend comes
immunity, comes protecting infection. going talk
why, epinephrine adrenaline best friend comes remembering
things learning activating neuroplasticity. going talk well.
again, question much long specific timing release

please see episode stress. Okay. cortisol epinephrine,


net effect increase energy. first all, want give tool will
help regulate cortisol can also help stave off certain patterns mental illness.
Now course not going cure mental illness own, can support healthy

first tool make sure highest levels cortisol first thing
morning wake up. One way another every 24 hours will get increase
cortisol. non-negotiable written genome. increasing
cortisol wake make alert, stimulate movement

said before, will say best way stimulate increase
cortisol appropriate time soon waking within 30 minutes
waking, get outside view sunlight, even overcast, get outside view
sunlight, no sunglasses. Never look light bright damage eyes,
two 10 minutes. bright two minutes, not bright 10
minutes. that, early part day opportunity time
cortisol release early part day, will improve, backed
peer reviewed studies, will improve focus, will improve energy levels,
will improve learning throughout day. will also prevent late shift
cortisol increase. late shifted cortisol, meaning cortisol increases around 8:00
9:00 PM signature feature many depressive disorders, including major

00:30:04 Ways Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Good



experience throughout day. Now, ways leverage stress,
epinephrine cortisol ways serve deliberate way.
also ways increase level stress threshold, meaning make
less likely epinephrine cortisol will released. want talk
science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use
when, want review now light scientific literature,
can build practices daily maybe every day routine
can really help buffer unhealthy levels cortisol epinephrine. Meaning
cortisol increases much great, lasts much long. Epinephrine
increases much great, last much long. course talk
negatives go along much cortisol, much
epinephrine long. hear lot. hear Cushing
syndrome, hear abdominal fat accumulation. hear sleep
disturbances. want arm tools first can talk dark
side, things hopefully able avoid entirely, can get
tools hand. say somebody tells something
troubling, look phone see text message really
upsetting you. will cause immediate increase epinephrine adrenaline
brain body. chances going increase levels cortisol
well. say get ice bath cold shower, even love cold,
hate cold, will cause equivalent increase epinephrine cortisol.
don't know exact levels probably same. say go
high intensity interval training, decide going run sprints,
repeats, going weightlifting gym love lifting weights
gym. Maybe like power lifting thing, decide want
hot yoga, thing really enjoy, hate, going increase
epinephrine cortisol levels. simply no way around this. say


decide sit going deep breathing. hear
benefits deep breathing. inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. going get big
increases epinephrine cortisol. data multiple studies support this.
stressors air quotes. Now way can cognitively reframe
are. can tell love high intensity interval training, love weight
training. personally love exercise. not crazy cold, cold exposure
stuff now again, going talk lot optimal way
upcoming episode. know, getting cold doesn't feel good me.
tell good enjoy point usually getting out.
increase epinephrine guess what, increase levels energy
alertness. somebody struggles energy alertness can
beneficial, provided get clearance doctor sort protocol
built day deliberately increase levels epinephrine

that? Well, quite easy turn shower cold get that, will wake up.
literally wakes increases epinephrine. can deep
breathing sort inhale exhale repeatedly 25 30 times, maybe hold
breath seconds exhale repeat, so-called Wim Hoff,
tummo type breathing. Lots adrenaline released system that.
will energy afterwards. really important understand
body doesn't distinguish troubling text message, ice, tummo breathing,
high intensity interval training, kind exercise, stress. Cognitively
reframing telling like this, enjoy it. not going change way
molecule impacts body brain. sort chuckle people
love tell

00:35:00 Mindset Stress Matter?

say, "Oh, good me." No. tell
good enjoy it. liberates molecules like
dopamine serotonin help buffer epinephrine response. Now, way
that, talked previous episode, just mention dopamine
precursor epinephrine. Epinephrine, adrenaline made dopamine, okay?
Cortisol made cholesterol. Epinephrine made dopamine.


tell enjoying something, dopamine subjective
can ways, long not completely lying yourself, can get

scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system

opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine

can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.

01:03:20 Coffee Changes Brain & Increases Connectivity “Anxiety Circuits”

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low

people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-

simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure

system, want cover three topics promised mention previous
episodes. first one relates intermittent fasting. second one relates


stomach grumbles. forgot mention biology last time. third
powerful way increase growth hormone, powerful increasing metabolism,
fat burning, tissue repair, et cetera. doesn't involve sauna wrapping
plastic bags going jog. first intermittent fasting. Last episode
talked lot growth hormone thyroid hormone, mentioned things like
sauna exercise, sleep, can increase levels growth hormone
within healthy ranges. increasing growth hormone can beneficial
can burn off body fat, can improve muscle general tissue health,
cartilage, et cetera. tend lose, levels growth hormone reduced
age. Many people asked me, "well, fasting?" Everyone's promised
internet intermittent fasting leads big increases growth hormone.
reason didn't mention couldn't find study actually pointed
underlying mechanism. saw lots claims, lots podcasts. Lots degrees behind
people's names, sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely different fields talking
this, studies. found consider study. will link
study. Turns fasting increase growth hormone levels way
fascinating. mentioned previous podcast hunger timing
meals timing hunger, hungry release hormone
body called ghrelin, sometimes actually called ghrelin. Thanks ghrelinisters,
ghrelinisters corrected pronunciation, ghrelin ghrelin, either one
works. Ghrelin makes hungry, blood glucose, blood sugar low, ghrelin
secreted makes hungry. turns ghrelin, hunger hormone
actually binds receptor brain normally binds called growth
hormone releasing hormone. believe not hunger hormone can act like growth
hormone releasing hormone thereby stimulate growth hormone. Now levels
growth hormone fasting promotes ghrelin system pretty substantial.
doubling growth hormone levels waking state. know
can release growth hormone sleep, intermittent fasting turns can increase
growth hormone binding ghrelin growth hormone, releasing hormone receptor
also daytime. yes indeed fasting can increase growth
hormone, not super levels taking growth hormone increase it,
sauna increase it, seem increase growth hormone. Later today's
episode going talk lot different patterns fasting eating can
control epinephrine. will turn specifics long fast. need


fast two three days, 23 hours? Fortunately people like love eat,

cholesterol produced liver. many probably know relationship
dietary cholesterol, fats eat blood cholesterol, liver
cholesterol controversial one. barbed wire topic. people
claim dietary cholesterol zero impact circulating cholesterol coming


liver, people argue exact opposite, good data hand
say. problems idea cholesterol levels

cholesterol liver produces, even though eating little
sometimes not eating all. understand cholesterol precursor molecule,
meaning substrate lot things like testosterone estrogen
made. Please also understand cholesterol can made estrogen,
testosterone, cortisol. cortisol sort competitive partner estrogen
testosterone. means is, no matter much cholesterol eating
produce, whether not low high, stressed
cholesterol going devoted toward creating cortisol, indeed stress
hormone. However, word stress shouldn't stress out, need cortisol,
cortisol vital. don't want cortisol levels low. important
immune system function, memory, not getting depressed. just don't want
cortisol levels high don't want elevated even normal

also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad

stomach grumbles. forgot mention biology last time. third
powerful way increase growth hormone, powerful increasing metabolism,
fat burning, tissue repair, et cetera. doesn't involve sauna wrapping
plastic bags going jog. first intermittent fasting. Last episode
talked lot growth hormone thyroid hormone, mentioned things like
sauna exercise, sleep, can increase levels growth hormone
within healthy ranges. increasing growth hormone can beneficial
can burn off body fat, can improve muscle general tissue health,
cartilage, et cetera. tend lose, levels growth hormone reduced
age. Many people asked me, "well, fasting?" Everyone's promised
internet intermittent fasting leads big increases growth hormone.
reason didn't mention couldn't find study actually pointed
underlying mechanism. saw lots claims, lots podcasts. Lots degrees behind
people's names, sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely different fields talking
this, studies. found consider study. will link
study. Turns fasting increase growth hormone levels way
fascinating. mentioned previous podcast hunger timing
meals timing hunger, hungry release hormone
body called ghrelin, sometimes actually called ghrelin. Thanks ghrelinisters,
ghrelinisters corrected pronunciation, ghrelin ghrelin, either one
works. Ghrelin makes hungry, blood glucose, blood sugar low, ghrelin
secreted makes hungry. turns ghrelin, hunger hormone
actually binds receptor brain normally binds called growth
hormone releasing hormone. believe not hunger hormone can act like growth
hormone releasing hormone thereby stimulate growth hormone. Now levels
growth hormone fasting promotes ghrelin system pretty substantial.
doubling growth hormone levels waking state. know
can release growth hormone sleep, intermittent fasting turns can increase
growth hormone binding ghrelin growth hormone, releasing hormone receptor
also daytime. yes indeed fasting can increase growth
hormone, not super levels taking growth hormone increase it,
sauna increase it, seem increase growth hormone. Later today's
episode going talk lot different patterns fasting eating can
control epinephrine. will turn specifics long fast. need


fast two three days, 23 hours? Fortunately people like love eat,

00:11:56 Stomach Growls

not case. talk specific fasting protocols later episode. also
said, going talk tummy grumble, stomach growls not
fluid sifting around there. lot people think, Oh, know fluid
sifting around. Turns stomach smooth muscle lines sides
eat something don't every stomach cinches off
two ends like bag hose either end, 'cause essentially
digestive system is. nothing happens muscles line
sides stomach kind extend around stomach cables,
always food stomach, churn
stomach. literally turn muscles stomach like tumbler help
break food presumably didn't chew well enough 'cause eating
fast. don't food stomach churning continues.
contraction muscle, turning, literally turning muscles
don't flip completely, turning muscles, causes
stomach growling. don't want person meeting, sitting
quiet theater whose stomach growling,

00:13:09 Hot Baths & Hormones

chew food better. simple solution. last episode, talked lot
sauna, controlled safe hyperthermia can cause huge increases growth hormone
release anywhere 300 500, even 1600% increases growth hormone release.
Really staggeringly high increases. pointed many people don't saunas
yard homes, go measures
increase safely body heat. know, creating steam room bathroom,
jogging extra sweats kind thing. Many asked hot baths, hot
bags will increase growth hormone, however temperatures need order
increase growth hormone high enough run risk burn. really
can't make recommendations hot bath, can tolerate nice hot bath
going get growth hormone release. However, sauna


advantage able enter 175 degree, 200 degree environment, provided
not pregnant, not young child, et cetera. can safely.
getting big increases growth hormone. hot bath will lead lesser increases
growth hormone. going talk lot temperature regulation future
episode, always ever going start playing hyperthermia
hypothermia, cold baths, ice baths, hot showers, hot baths beyond kind
norm comfortable, extremely careful

00:14:35 Energy, Adrenaline (Epinephrine), & Cortisol

please consult doctor. think fair say people like
lot energy day, work day. like energy
taper off night. think fair say people don't enjoy sick.
Nobody wants get sick. words, want energy, want
immune system function well, ward off infections various kinds, bacterial
infections, viral infections, et cetera. turns two hormones
dominate processes enough energy healthy immune
system cortisol epinephrine. Epinephrine thing adrenaline.
body tend call adrenaline adrenaline, brain tend call adrenaline
epinephrine. sorry didn't create naming system. story
behind uninteresting not worth time. will use words adrenaline
epinephrine interchangeably today. Cortisol cortisol. just want cover little bit
cortisol epinephrine are? released body
brain?

00:15:48 Cortisol & Cholesterol, Competition Testosterone & Estrogen

can understand will understand better control them. First
all, cortisol steroid hormone much like estrogen testosterone
derived cholesterol. Now cholesterol eat,
cholesterol produced liver. many probably know relationship
dietary cholesterol, fats eat blood cholesterol, liver
cholesterol controversial one. barbed wire topic. people
claim dietary cholesterol zero impact circulating cholesterol coming


liver, people argue exact opposite, good data hand
say. problems idea cholesterol levels
determined dietary intake. Namely, anorexics often high levels
cholesterol liver produces, even though eating little
sometimes not eating all. understand cholesterol precursor molecule,
meaning substrate lot things like testosterone estrogen
made. Please also understand cholesterol can made estrogen,
testosterone, cortisol. cortisol sort competitive partner estrogen
testosterone. means is, no matter much cholesterol eating
produce, whether not low high, stressed
cholesterol going devoted toward creating cortisol, indeed stress
hormone. However, word stress shouldn't stress out, need cortisol,
cortisol vital. don't want cortisol levels low. important
immune system function, memory, not getting depressed. just don't want
cortisol levels high don't want elevated even normal
levels wrong time day.

00:17:54 Adrenaline (Epinephrine) (Immune Systems) Best Friend

going talk control timing level cortisol. Epinephrine
adrenaline also demonized bit. think stress hormone,
thing makes us anxious, fight flight. know, used get chased lions
tigers, bears, now don't. ancient hangover, wrong.
fact matter epinephrine best friend comes
immunity, comes protecting infection. going talk
why, epinephrine adrenaline best friend comes remembering
things learning activating neuroplasticity. going talk well.
again, question much long specific timing release

00:21:32 Tool: Time Cortisol Peak Waking Using Specific Light Intensities

please see episode stress. Okay. cortisol epinephrine,


net effect increase energy. first all, want give tool will
help regulate cortisol can also help stave off certain patterns mental illness.
Now course not going cure mental illness own, can support healthy
state mind, can help reduce unhealthy states mind, including depression.
first tool make sure highest levels cortisol first thing
morning wake up. One way another every 24 hours will get increase
cortisol. non-negotiable written genome. increasing
cortisol wake make alert, stimulate movement
sleep, presumably horizontal, getting starting move day.
said before, will say best way stimulate increase
cortisol appropriate time soon waking within 30 minutes
waking, get outside view sunlight, even overcast, get outside view
sunlight, no sunglasses. Never look light bright damage eyes,
two 10 minutes. bright two minutes, not bright 10
minutes. that, early part day opportunity time
cortisol release early part day, will improve, backed
peer reviewed studies, will improve focus, will improve energy levels,
will improve learning throughout day. will also prevent late shift
cortisol increase. late shifted cortisol, meaning cortisol increases around 8:00
9:00 PM signature feature many depressive disorders, including major
depression, anxiety. course correlates things like insomnia, et cetera.
key tool, don't know many already that, vital
do. Now mentioned sunlight even cloudy days specific reasons
that. want just briefly cover data episodes sleep, talked
brightness light regulating cortisol sleep. talked
measure lux, brightness, not specific enough realized based questions
received since episode. works, going outside getting
sunlight requires also tell long conditions. said
looking window not good, takes 50 times longer get much light, et
cetera, et cetera. Many, many questions told not specific enough.
going give data data will understand exactly long
need day. sunny day, no cloud cover, provided sun
not yet overhead. somewhere low sky just crossed horizon,
wake little bit later somewhat low sky. Basically


intensity light, brightness, somewhere around 100,000 Lux. Lux just
measurement brightness. want download app Light Meter, free

science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep

nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray

things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation

00:15:48 Cortisol & Cholesterol, Competition Testosterone & Estrogen

can understand will understand better control them. First
all, cortisol steroid hormone much like estrogen testosterone
derived cholesterol. Now cholesterol eat,
cholesterol produced liver. many probably know relationship
dietary cholesterol, fats eat blood cholesterol, liver
cholesterol controversial one. barbed wire topic. people
claim dietary cholesterol zero impact circulating cholesterol coming


liver, people argue exact opposite, good data hand
say. problems idea cholesterol levels
determined dietary intake. Namely, anorexics often high levels
cholesterol liver produces, even though eating little
sometimes not eating all. understand cholesterol precursor molecule,
meaning substrate lot things like testosterone estrogen
made. Please also understand cholesterol can made estrogen,
testosterone, cortisol. cortisol sort competitive partner estrogen
testosterone. means is, no matter much cholesterol eating
produce, whether not low high, stressed
cholesterol going devoted toward creating cortisol, indeed stress
hormone. However, word stress shouldn't stress out, need cortisol,
cortisol vital. don't want cortisol levels low. important
immune system function, memory, not getting depressed. just don't want
cortisol levels high don't want elevated even normal
levels wrong time day.

00:17:54 Adrenaline (Epinephrine) (Immune Systems) Best Friend

going talk control timing level cortisol. Epinephrine
adrenaline also demonized bit. think stress hormone,

tigers, bears, now don't. ancient hangover, wrong.
fact matter epinephrine best friend comes
immunity, comes protecting infection. going talk
why, epinephrine adrenaline best friend comes remembering

first tool make sure highest levels cortisol first thing
morning wake up. One way another every 24 hours will get increase
cortisol. non-negotiable written genome. increasing
cortisol wake make alert, stimulate movement
sleep, presumably horizontal, getting starting move day.
said before, will say best way stimulate increase
cortisol appropriate time soon waking within 30 minutes
waking, get outside view sunlight, even overcast, get outside view
sunlight, no sunglasses. Never look light bright damage eyes,
two 10 minutes. bright two minutes, not bright 10
minutes. that, early part day opportunity time
cortisol release early part day, will improve, backed
peer reviewed studies, will improve focus, will improve energy levels,
will improve learning throughout day. will also prevent late shift
cortisol increase. late shifted cortisol, meaning cortisol increases around 8:00
9:00 PM signature feature many depressive disorders, including major
depression, anxiety. course correlates things like insomnia, et cetera.
key tool, don't know many already that, vital
do. Now mentioned sunlight even cloudy days specific reasons
that. want just briefly cover data episodes sleep, talked
brightness light regulating cortisol sleep. talked
measure lux, brightness, not specific enough realized based questions
received since episode. works, going outside getting
sunlight requires also tell long conditions. said
looking window not good, takes 50 times longer get much light, et
cetera, et cetera. Many, many questions told not specific enough.
going give data data will understand exactly long

00:27:20 Brief Increases Cortisol & Adrenaline Boost Energy, Focus & Immunity

best way make sure time cortisol appropriately. Now
throughout day going experience different things. not


spending entire day trying optimize health. might be,
jobs families, commitments. Life enters
picture provides stressors, stressors, whatever may happen
be, difficult coworker, disappointment something, didn't get raise
expected, didn't get vacation expected. will cause

luxury just morning cortisol taper off. want
major cortisol early day can expect, expect increases
cortisol adrenaline throughout day based events unpleasant you.
me, events unpleasant things like traffic, emails
ask fill form can't find link. kinds things stress
out, human being. don't lose cool can feel level

tense little bit. key blips cortisol epinephrine need brief.
can't often lasting long state chronic cortisol
elevation chronic epinephrine elevation. system stress designed
increase alertness mobilize towards things, get frustrated, provide
opportunity change behavior. designed do. find
getting stressed staying stressed, great tools provide
stress episode relate things like double inhale exhale, so-called

level state agitation. understand that, won't quite troubled
little stress increases

00:30:04 Ways Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Good



experience throughout day. Now, ways leverage stress,
epinephrine cortisol ways serve deliberate way.
also ways increase level stress threshold, meaning make
less likely epinephrine cortisol will released. want talk
science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use
when, want review now light scientific literature,
can build practices daily maybe every day routine
can really help buffer unhealthy levels cortisol epinephrine. Meaning
cortisol increases much great, lasts much long. Epinephrine
increases much great, last much long. course talk
negatives go along much cortisol, much
epinephrine long. hear lot. hear Cushing
syndrome, hear abdominal fat accumulation. hear sleep
disturbances. want arm tools first can talk dark
side, things hopefully able avoid entirely, can get
tools hand. say somebody tells something
troubling, look phone see text message really
upsetting you. will cause immediate increase epinephrine adrenaline
brain body. chances going increase levels cortisol
well. say get ice bath cold shower, even love cold,
hate cold, will cause equivalent increase epinephrine cortisol.
don't know exact levels probably same. say go
high intensity interval training, decide going run sprints,
repeats, going weightlifting gym love lifting weights
gym. Maybe like power lifting thing, decide want
hot yoga, thing really enjoy, hate, going increase
epinephrine cortisol levels. simply no way around this. say


decide sit going deep breathing. hear
benefits deep breathing. inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. going get big
increases epinephrine cortisol. data multiple studies support this.
stressors air quotes. Now way can cognitively reframe
are. can tell love high intensity interval training, love weight
training. personally love exercise. not crazy cold, cold exposure
stuff now again, going talk lot optimal way
upcoming episode. know, getting cold doesn't feel good me.
tell good enjoy point usually getting out.
increase epinephrine guess what, increase levels energy
alertness. somebody struggles energy alertness can
beneficial, provided get clearance doctor sort protocol
built day deliberately increase levels epinephrine
levels cortisol. want put emphasis deliberately.
that? Well, quite easy turn shower cold get that, will wake up.
literally wakes increases epinephrine. can deep
breathing sort inhale exhale repeatedly 25 30 times, maybe hold
breath seconds exhale repeat, so-called Wim Hoff,
tummo type breathing. Lots adrenaline released system that.
will energy afterwards. really important understand
body doesn't distinguish troubling text message, ice, tummo breathing,
high intensity interval training, kind exercise, stress. Cognitively
reframing telling like this, enjoy it. not going change way
molecule impacts body brain. sort chuckle people
love tell

00:35:00 Mindset Stress Matter?

say, "Oh, good me." No. tell
good enjoy it. liberates molecules like
dopamine serotonin help buffer epinephrine response. Now, way
that, talked previous episode, just mention dopamine
precursor epinephrine. Epinephrine, adrenaline made dopamine, okay?
Cortisol made cholesterol. Epinephrine made dopamine.


tell enjoying something, dopamine subjective
can ways, long not completely lying yourself, can get
epinephrine, get mileage ability push something.
can sort reframe it, not really cognitive reframing. cognitive part
trigger, chemical substance actually occurring there. dopamine giving
epinephrine, bigger amplitude epinephrine release, gives
sense control. protocol anyone can use. want increase levels
energy, suffer low energy daytime,

00:36:15 Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described

whenever like alert. Pick practice can fairly
consistently, maybe every day, maybe every third day every fourth day, maybe
ice bath cold bath. Maybe cold shower. Maybe cyclic inhale exhale,
breathing protocol described, wasn't clear people always ask demo,
not going whole thing right now, willing rounds this,
cycles say. inhale. deeply, like.
25, 30 times repeatedly will start feel warm. People yoga community,
say generating heat. not generating heat, releasing adrenaline. Inhale
exhale, inhale exhale 25 30 times, will feel agitated stressed.
releasing adrenaline body releasing
norepinephrine brain, alert. can follow 25 30
breath cycles exhale hold, hold breath 15 30 seconds. Always,
always, always dry land. Never driving, operating heavy machinery,
standard safety protocols. Never near water please, people passed
died breath holds water. several deaths associated it,
land probably safer, clear doctor, 25, 30 breaths exhale hold, 25, 30
breasts exhale hold, 25 30 breasts exhale hold. like can
inhale hold within margins safety. protocols,
activities just equivalent, just stress. make good
us? actually benefit them? Now, course cold can
health promoting effects. can increase brown fat thermogenesis
metabolism, high intensity interval training, forms exercise course
cardiovascular effects can good us weight training, et cetera.


talking ways increase energy teach brain
body teach regulate stress response. addition
benefits actual practices talking building system

better buffer those. also talking ways can increase energy
overall. 'Cause today's episode about, energy immune system.
indeed, will talk can actually leverage specific protocols
increase immune system demand. great scientific data

00:39:00 Practices Increase Energy Without Increasing Stress

support one can that. biological mechanism important
want things, increase energy immune system demand.
Learn buffer stress demand real time. means taking protocols,

resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides

important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty

hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,

epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.

not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve

things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related

chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop

regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin

stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous

adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing

chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain

cholesterol produced liver. many probably know relationship
dietary cholesterol, fats eat blood cholesterol, liver
cholesterol controversial one. barbed wire topic. people
claim dietary cholesterol zero impact circulating cholesterol coming


liver, people argue exact opposite, good data hand
say. problems idea cholesterol levels
determined dietary intake. Namely, anorexics often high levels
cholesterol liver produces, even though eating little
sometimes not eating all. understand cholesterol precursor molecule,
meaning substrate lot things like testosterone estrogen
made. Please also understand cholesterol can made estrogen,
testosterone, cortisol. cortisol sort competitive partner estrogen
testosterone. means is, no matter much cholesterol eating
produce, whether not low high, stressed
cholesterol going devoted toward creating cortisol, indeed stress
hormone. However, word stress shouldn't stress out, need cortisol,
cortisol vital. don't want cortisol levels low. important
immune system function, memory, not getting depressed. just don't want
cortisol levels high don't want elevated even normal

experience throughout day. Now, ways leverage stress,
epinephrine cortisol ways serve deliberate way.
also ways increase level stress threshold, meaning make
less likely epinephrine cortisol will released. want talk
science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use
when, want review now light scientific literature,
can build practices daily maybe every day routine
can really help buffer unhealthy levels cortisol epinephrine. Meaning
cortisol increases much great, lasts much long. Epinephrine
increases much great, last much long. course talk
negatives go along much cortisol, much
epinephrine long. hear lot. hear Cushing

well. say get ice bath cold shower, even love cold,
hate cold, will cause equivalent increase epinephrine cortisol.
don't know exact levels probably same. say go
high intensity interval training, decide going run sprints,
repeats, going weightlifting gym love lifting weights
gym. Maybe like power lifting thing, decide want

love tell

00:35:00 Mindset Stress Matter?

say, "Oh, good me." No. tell
good enjoy it. liberates molecules like
dopamine serotonin help buffer epinephrine response. Now, way
that, talked previous episode, just mention dopamine
precursor epinephrine. Epinephrine, adrenaline made dopamine, okay?
Cortisol made cholesterol. Epinephrine made dopamine.


tell enjoying something, dopamine subjective
can ways, long not completely lying yourself, can get

00:36:15 Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described

whenever like alert. Pick practice can fairly
consistently, maybe every day, maybe every third day every fourth day, maybe
ice bath cold bath. Maybe cold shower. Maybe cyclic inhale exhale,
breathing protocol described, wasn't clear people always ask demo,
not going whole thing right now, willing rounds this,
cycles say. inhale. deeply, like.
25, 30 times repeatedly will start feel warm. People yoga community,

opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine

adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later

focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad

help regulate cortisol can also help stave off certain patterns mental illness.
Now course not going cure mental illness own, can support healthy
state mind, can help reduce unhealthy states mind, including depression.
first tool make sure highest levels cortisol first thing
morning wake up. One way another every 24 hours will get increase
cortisol. non-negotiable written genome. increasing
cortisol wake make alert, stimulate movement
sleep, presumably horizontal, getting starting move day.
said before, will say best way stimulate increase
cortisol appropriate time soon waking within 30 minutes
waking, get outside view sunlight, even overcast, get outside view
sunlight, no sunglasses. Never look light bright damage eyes,
two 10 minutes. bright two minutes, not bright 10
minutes. that, early part day opportunity time
cortisol release early part day, will improve, backed
peer reviewed studies, will improve focus, will improve energy levels,
will improve learning throughout day. will also prevent late shift
cortisol increase. late shifted cortisol, meaning cortisol increases around 8:00
9:00 PM signature feature many depressive disorders, including major
depression, anxiety. course correlates things like insomnia, et cetera.
key tool, don't know many already that, vital
do. Now mentioned sunlight even cloudy days specific reasons
that. want just briefly cover data episodes sleep, talked
brightness light regulating cortisol sleep. talked
measure lux, brightness, not specific enough realized based questions
received since episode. works, going outside getting

science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep

instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like

not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray

things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"

Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use

can build practices daily maybe every day routine
can really help buffer unhealthy levels cortisol epinephrine. Meaning
cortisol increases much great, lasts much long. Epinephrine
increases much great, last much long. course talk

whenever like alert. Pick practice can fairly
consistently, maybe every day, maybe every third day every fourth day, maybe
ice bath cold bath. Maybe cold shower. Maybe cyclic inhale exhale,
breathing protocol described, wasn't clear people always ask demo,
not going whole thing right now, willing rounds this,
cycles say. inhale. deeply, like.
25, 30 times repeatedly will start feel warm. People yoga community,
say generating heat. not generating heat, releasing adrenaline. Inhale
exhale, inhale exhale 25 30 times, will feel agitated stressed.
releasing adrenaline body releasing
norepinephrine brain, alert. can follow 25 30
breath cycles exhale hold, hold breath 15 30 seconds. Always,
always, always dry land. Never driving, operating heavy machinery,
standard safety protocols. Never near water please, people passed

land probably safer, clear doctor, 25, 30 breaths exhale hold, 25, 30
breasts exhale hold, 25 30 breasts exhale hold. like can
inhale hold within margins safety. protocols,
activities just equivalent, just stress. make good

stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous

probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like
phrase, sort of... don't want anecdotal data ever misunderstood
anything anecdotal data. Anecdotally, can say instances felt
throat tickle coming sinus infection, will cyclic breathing

exhale hold, big inhale hold. times didn't get full blown sick,
also take precautionary measures get sleep, et cetera. whether not
causal, whether not just correlated don't know. However, human

short takeaway get cortisol release early day will


increase energy throughout day, will also time thyroid release properly.
yet another reason want get light exposure early

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit
exam. actually happen sat exam just blanked, just
blanked. happened once, don't know happened. don't think sleep
deprivation just completely blanked. hard pull
ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people
either focus somatic response much. Like feel like sweating,


focused bodily response, not focused trying
do, say, perform, et cetera, learn. epinephrine nootropic, smart
drug make internally, cortisol well. Now twist
not mean want epinephrine high exam necessarily. Memory
learning performance actually favored, enhanced epinephrine

timing vital. learn information, conversation trying
learn new language, new motor skill. Whatever trying learn,
increase epinephrine occurs just afterward going consolidate

neuroplasticity engaged sleep later night next night
real rewiring occurs. might say, "That's crazy, happen?"
Well, remember, none mechanisms evolved us
want learn want necessarily although will allow us that.

ensuring good night's sleep learning. also talking


learning event tapers off, exiting that, make sure epinephrine levels

01:03:20 Coffee Changes Brain & Increases Connectivity “Anxiety Circuits”

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"

net effect increase energy. first all, want give tool will
help regulate cortisol can also help stave off certain patterns mental illness.
Now course not going cure mental illness own, can support healthy
state mind, can help reduce unhealthy states mind, including depression.
first tool make sure highest levels cortisol first thing
morning wake up. One way another every 24 hours will get increase
cortisol. non-negotiable written genome. increasing
cortisol wake make alert, stimulate movement
sleep, presumably horizontal, getting starting move day.
said before, will say best way stimulate increase
cortisol appropriate time soon waking within 30 minutes
waking, get outside view sunlight, even overcast, get outside view
sunlight, no sunglasses. Never look light bright damage eyes,
two 10 minutes. bright two minutes, not bright 10
minutes. that, early part day opportunity time
cortisol release early part day, will improve, backed
peer reviewed studies, will improve focus, will improve energy levels,
will improve learning throughout day. will also prevent late shift
cortisol increase. late shifted cortisol, meaning cortisol increases around 8:00
9:00 PM signature feature many depressive disorders, including major
depression, anxiety. course correlates things like insomnia, et cetera.
key tool, don't know many already that, vital
do. Now mentioned sunlight even cloudy days specific reasons
that. want just briefly cover data episodes sleep, talked
brightness light regulating cortisol sleep. talked
measure lux, brightness, not specific enough realized based questions
received since episode. works, going outside getting
sunlight requires also tell long conditions. said
looking window not good, takes 50 times longer get much light, et
cetera, et cetera. Many, many questions told not specific enough.
going give data data will understand exactly long
need day. sunny day, no cloud cover, provided sun
not yet overhead. somewhere low sky just crossed horizon,
wake little bit later somewhat low sky. Basically


intensity light, brightness, somewhere around 100,000 Lux. Lux just
measurement brightness. want download app Light Meter, free
app will allow that. can hold finger little button
can move around, will continuously give Lux read out. not
perfect, not exact, pretty good. zero cost. no relationship
Light Meter company. cloudy day 10,000 Lux. Okay. tenfold
reduction. bright artificial light, bright artificial light somewhere around 1000
lux. ordinary room light somewhere around 100-200 lux.
much light scatter is. even bright bulb sitting right next you,
not going job. phone will not job not early day get
cortisol released appropriate time need get outside. just set
couple general parameters. bright outside no cloud cover light can
indirect. don't staring sun, please don't damage eyes.
can't regenerate neurons yet restore vision lost, blink,
means bright. fine blink course, please need to. Get outside
10 minutes, five minutes suffice, 10 minutes sure suffice.
cloudy day, dense overcast, probably going need 30 minutes. light
cloud broken cloud cover probably going somewhere 10 20
minutes. can't get outside airplane bright overhead,
artificial lights ordinary room lights going take six hours light.
time reach middle sort wakeful period, late. won't
able shift clock cortisol will start drifting later later.
vital get light regular basis, get cortisol released early day.
sets optimal levels energy, sets great sleep. today's not
really sleep energy cortisol pulse stress might
feel early day little bit extra energy. energy want
order move learn, various things. healthy level
energy. please try get sunlight. within protocols that, try
get sufficient sunlight first thing morning, within first hour.

00:27:20 Brief Increases Cortisol & Adrenaline Boost Energy, Focus & Immunity

best way make sure time cortisol appropriately. Now
throughout day going experience different things. not


spending entire day trying optimize health. might be,

little stress increases

00:30:04 Ways Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Good



experience throughout day. Now, ways leverage stress,
epinephrine cortisol ways serve deliberate way.
also ways increase level stress threshold, meaning make
less likely epinephrine cortisol will released. want talk
science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use
when, want review now light scientific literature,
can build practices daily maybe every day routine
can really help buffer unhealthy levels cortisol epinephrine. Meaning
cortisol increases much great, lasts much long. Epinephrine
increases much great, last much long. course talk
negatives go along much cortisol, much
epinephrine long. hear lot. hear Cushing
syndrome, hear abdominal fat accumulation. hear sleep
disturbances. want arm tools first can talk dark
side, things hopefully able avoid entirely, can get
tools hand. say somebody tells something
troubling, look phone see text message really
upsetting you. will cause immediate increase epinephrine adrenaline
brain body. chances going increase levels cortisol
well. say get ice bath cold shower, even love cold,
hate cold, will cause equivalent increase epinephrine cortisol.
don't know exact levels probably same. say go
high intensity interval training, decide going run sprints,
repeats, going weightlifting gym love lifting weights
gym. Maybe like power lifting thing, decide want
hot yoga, thing really enjoy, hate, going increase
epinephrine cortisol levels. simply no way around this. say


decide sit going deep breathing. hear
benefits deep breathing. inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. going get big
increases epinephrine cortisol. data multiple studies support this.
stressors air quotes. Now way can cognitively reframe
are. can tell love high intensity interval training, love weight
training. personally love exercise. not crazy cold, cold exposure
stuff now again, going talk lot optimal way
upcoming episode. know, getting cold doesn't feel good me.
tell good enjoy point usually getting out.
increase epinephrine guess what, increase levels energy
alertness. somebody struggles energy alertness can
beneficial, provided get clearance doctor sort protocol
built day deliberately increase levels epinephrine
levels cortisol. want put emphasis deliberately.
that? Well, quite easy turn shower cold get that, will wake up.
literally wakes increases epinephrine. can deep
breathing sort inhale exhale repeatedly 25 30 times, maybe hold
breath seconds exhale repeat, so-called Wim Hoff,
tummo type breathing. Lots adrenaline released system that.
will energy afterwards. really important understand
body doesn't distinguish troubling text message, ice, tummo breathing,
high intensity interval training, kind exercise, stress. Cognitively
reframing telling like this, enjoy it. not going change way
molecule impacts body brain. sort chuckle people
love tell

00:35:00 Mindset Stress Matter?

say, "Oh, good me." No. tell
good enjoy it. liberates molecules like
dopamine serotonin help buffer epinephrine response. Now, way
that, talked previous episode, just mention dopamine
precursor epinephrine. Epinephrine, adrenaline made dopamine, okay?
Cortisol made cholesterol. Epinephrine made dopamine.


tell enjoying something, dopamine subjective
can ways, long not completely lying yourself, can get
epinephrine, get mileage ability push something.
can sort reframe it, not really cognitive reframing. cognitive part
trigger, chemical substance actually occurring there. dopamine giving
epinephrine, bigger amplitude epinephrine release, gives
sense control. protocol anyone can use. want increase levels
energy, suffer low energy daytime,

00:36:15 Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described

whenever like alert. Pick practice can fairly
consistently, maybe every day, maybe every third day every fourth day, maybe
ice bath cold bath. Maybe cold shower. Maybe cyclic inhale exhale,
breathing protocol described, wasn't clear people always ask demo,
not going whole thing right now, willing rounds this,
cycles say. inhale. deeply, like.
25, 30 times repeatedly will start feel warm. People yoga community,
say generating heat. not generating heat, releasing adrenaline. Inhale
exhale, inhale exhale 25 30 times, will feel agitated stressed.
releasing adrenaline body releasing
norepinephrine brain, alert. can follow 25 30
breath cycles exhale hold, hold breath 15 30 seconds. Always,
always, always dry land. Never driving, operating heavy machinery,
standard safety protocols. Never near water please, people passed
died breath holds water. several deaths associated it,
land probably safer, clear doctor, 25, 30 breaths exhale hold, 25, 30
breasts exhale hold, 25 30 breasts exhale hold. like can
inhale hold within margins safety. protocols,
activities just equivalent, just stress. make good
us? actually benefit them? Now, course cold can
health promoting effects. can increase brown fat thermogenesis
metabolism, high intensity interval training, forms exercise course
cardiovascular effects can good us weight training, et cetera.


talking ways increase energy teach brain
body teach regulate stress response. addition
benefits actual practices talking building system
experience increases epinephrine cortisol life events able
better buffer those. also talking ways can increase energy
overall. 'Cause today's episode about, energy immune system.
indeed, will talk can actually leverage specific protocols
increase immune system demand. great scientific data

00:39:00 Practices Increase Energy Without Increasing Stress

support one can that. biological mechanism important
want things, increase energy immune system demand.
Learn buffer stress demand real time. means taking protocols,
practices whether not cold water, ice bath, exercise,
making one small powerful adjustment perform them.

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like
phrase, sort of... don't want anecdotal data ever misunderstood
anything anecdotal data. Anecdotally, can say instances felt
throat tickle coming sinus infection, will cyclic breathing
described before. 25, 30 breasts exhale hold, 25 30 breasts exhale hold, 25, 30 breaths
exhale hold, big inhale hold. times didn't get full blown sick,
also take precautionary measures get sleep, et cetera. whether not
causal, whether not just correlated don't know. However, human
study definitely want point you, published recently

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit

use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline

immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want

short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase

effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means

three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like
phrase, sort of... don't want anecdotal data ever misunderstood
anything anecdotal data. Anecdotally, can say instances felt
throat tickle coming sinus infection, will cyclic breathing

short takeaway get cortisol release early day will


increase energy throughout day, will also time thyroid release properly.
yet another reason want get light exposure early

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit
exam. actually happen sat exam just blanked, just
blanked. happened once, don't know happened. don't think sleep
deprivation just completely blanked. hard pull
ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people
either focus somatic response much. Like feel like sweating,


focused bodily response, not focused trying
do, say, perform, et cetera, learn. epinephrine nootropic, smart
drug make internally, cortisol well. Now twist
not mean want epinephrine high exam necessarily. Memory
learning performance actually favored, enhanced epinephrine

timing vital. learn information, conversation trying
learn new language, new motor skill. Whatever trying learn,
increase epinephrine occurs just afterward going consolidate

ensuring good night's sleep learning. also talking


learning event tapers off, exiting that, make sure epinephrine levels

01:03:20 Coffee Changes Brain & Increases Connectivity “Anxiety Circuits”

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"

experience throughout day. Now, ways leverage stress,
epinephrine cortisol ways serve deliberate way.
also ways increase level stress threshold, meaning make
less likely epinephrine cortisol will released. want talk
science practices, 'cause get asked practices lot. Things like
Wim Hof breathing also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things
like high intensity interval training. things utility. question
use often use them. tools just like stress life event
can either enhance immunity deplete it. right practices ice
baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, training kind can
deplete immune system can improve them. Excuse me, can improve it,
meaning can improve immune system. key often use
when, want review now light scientific literature,
can build practices daily maybe every day routine
can really help buffer unhealthy levels cortisol epinephrine. Meaning
cortisol increases much great, lasts much long. Epinephrine
increases much great, last much long. course talk
negatives go along much cortisol, much

Cortisol made cholesterol. Epinephrine made dopamine.


tell enjoying something, dopamine subjective
can ways, long not completely lying yourself, can get

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like
phrase, sort of... don't want anecdotal data ever misunderstood
anything anecdotal data. Anecdotally, can say instances felt
throat tickle coming sinus infection, will cyclic breathing
described before. 25, 30 breasts exhale hold, 25 30 breasts exhale hold, 25, 30 breaths
exhale hold, big inhale hold. times didn't get full blown sick,
also take precautionary measures get sleep, et cetera. whether not
causal, whether not just correlated don't know. However, human
study definitely want point you, published recently

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit

ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people

use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad

people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict

simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com
zero cost can see so-called human effect matrix. Ashwagandha
many uses, used enhance power output athletes shown


modestly increase testosterone. shown modestly adjust things like low

great. Six studies. mentions significantly larger many
supplements. Now, people will say taking Ashwagandha chronically may not
good. heard that, can point specific studies indicate
exactly not good, please put comment section let know.

genders. number subjects reasonably high, 64 more. One six
months study, long-term studies. great, like see not just
acute study. males females lots different ages overweight non
overweight. blood draws cortisol going end well saliva
test. Saliva actually best way measure free cortisol. can also measure
ear wax turns sounds pretty gross kind is. nonetheless
cortisol will accumulate earwax saliva, free cortisol. six
quality studies, independently supported points significant,
know, 14.5 27.9% reductions otherwise healthy adults. somebody
dealing chronic stress, stressful period life want stave off
negative effects stress. Well ashwagandha may, want highlight, may

actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty

not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes

short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later

focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes

increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep

not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention

nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic

things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic

chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress

really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin

them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like
phrase, sort of... don't want anecdotal data ever misunderstood
anything anecdotal data. Anecdotally, can say instances felt
throat tickle coming sinus infection, will cyclic breathing

exhale hold, big inhale hold. times didn't get full blown sick,
also take precautionary measures get sleep, et cetera. whether not
causal, whether not just correlated don't know. However, human
study definitely want point you, published recently

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit
exam. actually happen sat exam just blanked, just
blanked. happened once, don't know happened. don't think sleep
deprivation just completely blanked. hard pull
ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people
either focus somatic response much. Like feel like sweating,


focused bodily response, not focused trying
do, say, perform, et cetera, learn. epinephrine nootropic, smart
drug make internally, cortisol well. Now twist
not mean want epinephrine high exam necessarily. Memory
learning performance actually favored, enhanced epinephrine

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put

not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting

people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-
ups phone. things can take, feel like chronically
stressed veering toward negative effects stress many.
simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com
zero cost can see so-called human effect matrix. Ashwagandha
many uses, used enhance power output athletes shown

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like

00:55:11 Timing Thyroid Release Energy

good timing cortisol. also mention another hormone
discussed last episode thyroid hormone critical setting level

short takeaway get cortisol release early day will


increase energy throughout day, will also time thyroid release properly.
yet another reason want get light exposure early

ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get

came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put

not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,

question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress

cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed

opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms

Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine

something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline

increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking
epinephrine cortisol increasing energy immune system function
largely independent blood glucose. course, interact
system, heard much growing need eat energy, energy
talking today actually much powerful one one

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad

00:45:00 Using Stressors ENHANCE Immune System: Science & Tools

need understand immediate period following practice
system, entire brain body different. body actually primed
resist infection, high levels epinephrine short periods time.
scientific study explored increasing adrenaline body can improve
immune resistance grounded well-known phenomenon increases stress
actually protect infection short term. want look classic
data first, describe done. want talk recent study
immediately actionable. classic set studies really based
mainly work somebody named Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller
University New York. Bruce passed away years ago, many decades
incredibly impactful work belt did. work going talk
next done humans done animals, really
explored inducing stress can enhance function immune system
short term. when, mean short term, mean one four days. not going
go details study, essentially
exposing subjects sort infection, either bacterial viral infection,
inducing stress. sounds like double whammy, right? think maybe getting
little electric foot shock, cold water exposure, something increase levels
stress adrenaline just make effects infection worse, no, quite
opposite. Brief bouts stress, now thinking terms
cortisol epinephrine release actually able increase immune system function.


Now shouldn't surprise understand little bit epinephrine
works body brain. essentially signal nervous
system can inform immune organs, things like spleen organs make
killer cells various kinds, B cells T cells, go combat infections, bacteria,
viruses. else immune system know infection?
immune system can recognize foreign invaders nervous system provides
signal, sort alarm signal liberates killer cells, tells
problem go seek problem speak. duration really
important stress stayed high long, yes indeed stress can
hinder immune response. period one four days, actually can
protect way increasing immune response. Now, can say certainty
effect governed epinephrine, adrenaline released adrenals
not brain, actually explored whether not effect exists
presence called adrenalectomy, removing adrenals. just
say, without adrenals don't get effect. know effect comes
adrenaline body. mean you? means want
increase immune system short term want increase epinephrine
short-term. short bouts intense exercise probably no
hour per day, provided everything else right, sleeping nutrition, et
cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline
release. can breathing, can cold exposure, can exercise.


mechanism key, keep saying means
don't actually know specific protocol. not trying say, particular
protocol. figure out, easy figure short term
adrenaline increasing behavior willing regular basis every day, two
three times week. Now say, well, not sick.
things often? say, two three times week minimum goal keep
immune system tuned presence lot children
instance, carry lot bugs, immune system isn't developed,
work healthcare setting, simply somebody prone get sick. can
just say anecdotally, guess someone now calls anecdata don't like

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"

cetera, maybe even shorter bouts intense exercise exposure cold water,
cyclical breathing talked before, increase epinephrine will
bolster immune system. hear reports every while,
seems thing every there'll article coffee
can improve immune system, something like that. Indeed caffeine can increase
epinephrine dopamine extent, people drinking chronically.
effects probably due increases epinephrine probably whether not
something like coffee forms caffeine can improve degrade immune
system will probably depend whether not using way increases
adrenaline spike, happens rarely, know, every two three
months, say infection coming on, yes, indeed. data
probably mean drinking hot caffeinated tea hot coffee even
provided don't get dehydrated also drinking water can
probably improve immune system function, way increasing adrenaline

short takeaway get cortisol release early day will


increase energy throughout day, will also time thyroid release properly.
yet another reason want get light exposure early
day. non-negotiable practice. plane, try get way

number studies, Kalsbeek et al. Kalsbeek et al. 2012. want
look PubMed great one, describes cortisol secretion begins rise
sleep peaks shortly waking immediately before. times set
neurons circadian clock trigger release releasing
stimulating hormones thyroid. really important mechanism, thyroid will also
tend correlate energy mostly metabolism. important thyroid

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit
exam. actually happen sat exam just blanked, just
blanked. happened once, don't know happened. don't think sleep
deprivation just completely blanked. hard pull
ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people
either focus somatic response much. Like feel like sweating,


focused bodily response, not focused trying

drug make internally, cortisol well. Now twist
not mean want epinephrine high exam necessarily. Memory
learning performance actually favored, enhanced epinephrine

ensuring good night's sleep learning. also talking


learning event tapers off, exiting that, make sure epinephrine levels

01:03:20 Coffee Changes Brain & Increases Connectivity “Anxiety Circuits”

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting

people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict

lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going

00:55:11 Timing Thyroid Release Energy

good timing cortisol. also mention another hormone
discussed last episode thyroid hormone critical setting level
metabolism controlled part circadian mechanisms cortisol itself.
short takeaway get cortisol release early day will


increase energy throughout day, will also time thyroid release properly.
yet another reason want get light exposure early
day. non-negotiable practice. plane, try get way
can. not shining flashlights eyes yet, really try hard get light
exposure sunlight early day without fail. thyroid increase
fact circadian clock regulated cortisol circadian
clock times release thyroid hormone. don't want go far off direction,
number studies, Kalsbeek et al. Kalsbeek et al. 2012. want
look PubMed great one, describes cortisol secretion begins rise
sleep peaks shortly waking immediately before. times set
neurons circadian clock trigger release releasing
stimulating hormones thyroid. really important mechanism, thyroid will also
tend correlate energy mostly metabolism. important thyroid
check.

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit
exam. actually happen sat exam just blanked, just
blanked. happened once, don't know happened. don't think sleep
deprivation just completely blanked. hard pull
ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people
either focus somatic response much. Like feel like sweating,


focused bodily response, not focused trying
do, say, perform, et cetera, learn. epinephrine nootropic, smart
drug make internally, cortisol well. Now twist
not mean want epinephrine high exam necessarily. Memory
learning performance actually favored, enhanced epinephrine
increases immediately learning. something rarely discussed,
timing vital. learn information, conversation trying
learn new language, new motor skill. Whatever trying learn,
increase epinephrine occurs just afterward going consolidate
information. going ensure proper circuits mechanisms brain
neuroplasticity engaged sleep later night next night
real rewiring occurs. might say, "That's crazy, happen?"
Well, remember, none mechanisms evolved us
want learn want necessarily although will allow us that.
experienced before, might gotten up, gone outside get car, drive
work somebody's house not thinking much all,
sudden see accident road. alertness primed happens
particularly gory accident, going lot sensory information there.
sudden adrenaline, epinephrine released brain body. Guess what?
Not will not forget event, will remember everything led

everything preceded spike adrenaline cortisol. way think
need learn something better, taking Adderall, taking
lot coffee beforehand actually driving process wrong direction.
increasing epinephrine learning sure, past certain point actually
degrading learning performance. time toward end
immediately learning, mechanism not simply devoted

told just experienced important, going need information
later. talked many times using non sleep deep rest NSDR,
ensuring good night's sleep learning. also talking


learning event tapers off, exiting that, make sure epinephrine levels
not tapering off well. may one reasons 90 minute cycle,
so-called ultradian cycle learning works, takes minutes get
rhythm learning. can maintain alertness 90 minutes, no
coincidence podcasts typically 90 minutes long. exit
90 minutes going start feel fatigued. not going able continue
secrete epinephrine level. not telling end

01:03:20 Coffee Changes Brain & Increases Connectivity “Anxiety Circuits”

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking
epinephrine cortisol increasing energy immune system function
largely independent blood glucose. course, interact
system, heard much growing need eat energy, energy
talking today actually much powerful one one
derive food, call neural energy. neurotransmitters create
alertness, focus, willingness ability move. willingness

epinephrine. focused today. now talking


01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting
light feeding exercise sleep consistent schedule
consistent ish going powerful thing can order buffer
negative effects mental health physical health matter.
things one can take supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.
may may know people Cushing's, chronically
elevated cortisol. prescription drugs will talk can used.
people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-
ups phone. things can take, feel like chronically
stressed veering toward negative effects stress many.
simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com
zero cost can see so-called human effect matrix. Ashwagandha
many uses, used enhance power output athletes shown


modestly increase testosterone. shown modestly adjust things like low

00:55:11 Timing Thyroid Release Energy

good timing cortisol. also mention another hormone
discussed last episode thyroid hormone critical setting level
metabolism controlled part circadian mechanisms cortisol itself.
short takeaway get cortisol release early day will


increase energy throughout day, will also time thyroid release properly.
yet another reason want get light exposure early
day. non-negotiable practice. plane, try get way
can. not shining flashlights eyes yet, really try hard get light
exposure sunlight early day without fail. thyroid increase
fact circadian clock regulated cortisol circadian
clock times release thyroid hormone. don't want go far off direction,
number studies, Kalsbeek et al. Kalsbeek et al. 2012. want
look PubMed great one, describes cortisol secretion begins rise
sleep peaks shortly waking immediately before. times set
neurons circadian clock trigger release releasing
stimulating hormones thyroid. really important mechanism, thyroid will also
tend correlate energy mostly metabolism. important thyroid

00:57:02 Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
Learning

Now talk epinephrine cortisol, learning memory. Everyone
story stressed couldn't remember something. know, sit
exam. actually happen sat exam just blanked, just
blanked. happened once, don't know happened. don't think sleep
deprivation just completely blanked. hard pull
ditch. manage it, scary experience. think people
think stress inability perform. However, time increases
epinephrine provided not roof lead improved performance. Now
shown memory tests, learning new information,
physical performance. blood levels epinephrine low don't
perform well. blood levels epinephrine high 1500
1700 pg/mL. anyone's there, actually measuring stuff doubt
are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better alert
little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, again, again. get
stressed, mental side, epinephrine brain causes people
either focus somatic response much. Like feel like sweating,


focused bodily response, not focused trying

drug make internally, cortisol well. Now twist
not mean want epinephrine high exam necessarily. Memory
learning performance actually favored, enhanced epinephrine

timing vital. learn information, conversation trying
learn new language, new motor skill. Whatever trying learn,
increase epinephrine occurs just afterward going consolidate

neuroplasticity engaged sleep later night next night
real rewiring occurs. might say, "That's crazy, happen?"
Well, remember, none mechanisms evolved us
want learn want necessarily although will allow us that.
experienced before, might gotten up, gone outside get car, drive

particularly gory accident, going lot sensory information there.
sudden adrenaline, epinephrine released brain body. Guess what?
Not will not forget event, will remember everything led

ensuring good night's sleep learning. also talking


learning event tapers off, exiting that, make sure epinephrine levels
not tapering off well. may one reasons 90 minute cycle,
so-called ultradian cycle learning works, takes minutes get
rhythm learning. can maintain alertness 90 minutes, no
coincidence podcasts typically 90 minutes long. exit
90 minutes going start feel fatigued. not going able continue

01:03:20 Coffee Changes Brain & Increases Connectivity “Anxiety Circuits”

organization tools enhanced learning. course use
caffeine prime whole process drinking caffeine towards tail
learning episode, counter-intuitive least me. mention since many
use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort
circuits opposed just listing off bunch brain circuits,
kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later
learning focus sessions way enhance plasticity around learning
focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking
epinephrine cortisol increasing energy immune system function
largely independent blood glucose. course, interact
system, heard much growing need eat energy, energy
talking today actually much powerful one one
derive food, call neural energy. neurotransmitters create
alertness, focus, willingness ability move. willingness

often think food energy great is, sources

epinephrine. focused today. now talking


01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting
light feeding exercise sleep consistent schedule

people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-
ups phone. things can take, feel like chronically

simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com
zero cost can see so-called human effect matrix. Ashwagandha
many uses, used enhance power output athletes shown


modestly increase testosterone. shown modestly adjust things like low

use caffeine use caffeine. drink coffee, love mushroom coffee. love
mate. drink caffeine various forms. study came recently
relevant discussion energy alertness, learning. study
came just recently March 2021, Maglhaes et al. MAGALHAES.
published molecular psychiatry fine journal, peer review journal.


title pretty much gives away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display distinct pattern brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
number ways key takeaways study, relates sort

kind meaningless conversation people drank coffee habitually every
day changes brain circuitry, shift bias toward
anxiety even don't ingest caffeine. lot times think, Oh caffeine
increases levels anxiety. indeed appears use chronically,
not just caffeine, doesn't just raise baseline anxiety
circulating bloodstream. actually increases connectivity brain
areas relate anxiety. Now good thing bad thing depending
look it. people prone chronic panic attacks anxiety
attacks not going good. people might use caffeine healthy ways.
believe order just increase overall levels alertness. Although now not
going start delaying caffeine intake till two hours wake reasons
talked previous episodes, also going start drinking later

focus sessions, not before.

01:05:43 Nootropics: Two Kinds, & & Work, “Neural Energy”

interesting study, free online. can access full paper online, will put
link well. want mention issue nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray


market, illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose work. neural effects hear
secondary tertiary fact just increased blood glucose. know
block blood glucose effect block nootropic effect, okay.
Others include, definitely don't take please, amphetamine, cocaine. will
increase learning short term particular dosages, increase
blood glucose. course, things like painful stimuli stress will improve
learning way increasing blood glucose. Now stress epinephrine
associated not improve performance learning about,
mentioned epinephrine come afterward will increase retention
information longterm. course, whole category
nootropics don't impact blood glucose, work increasing cholinergic
system activity. things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine,
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. there're ways increase energy don't
require increase blood glucose, vitally important. reason talking
epinephrine cortisol increasing energy immune system function
largely independent blood glucose. course, interact
system, heard much growing need eat energy, energy
talking today actually much powerful one one

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting
light feeding exercise sleep consistent schedule
consistent ish going powerful thing can order buffer

things one can take supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.
may may know people Cushing's, chronically
elevated cortisol. prescription drugs will talk can used.
people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-
ups phone. things can take, feel like chronically
stressed veering toward negative effects stress many.
simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com
zero cost can see so-called human effect matrix. Ashwagandha
many uses, used enhance power output athletes shown


modestly increase testosterone. shown modestly adjust things like low

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad

not topic particularly enjoy don't like name. don't like idea
nootropic, smart drug? Well, different kinds smart,
creativity, task switching, strategy building, strategy implementation.
nootropics just cocktails bunch different things
aren't tailored individual all. seem caffeine,
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. important way frame light
today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall two categories, one category
nootropics increase blood glucose. compounds people take
increased blood glucose increasing blood glucose will improve performance,
can enhance learning situations. not suggesting people take things,
just list those. legal, gray

immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic

chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous

01:09:00 Biology Comfort Foods: Negative Positive Feedback Loops

increasing energy increasing immune system way cortisol
epinephrine, totally remiss didn't cover cortisol epinephrine
chronically elevated, elevated high can lot detrimental effects.
things normally hear about. going describe things
also going talk ways ameliorate them. Ways can adjust cortisol


levels, even stressed. Ways can adjust epinephrine levels even
stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad

question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting
light feeding exercise sleep consistent schedule
consistent ish going powerful thing can order buffer
negative effects mental health physical health matter.
things one can take supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.
may may know people Cushing's, chronically
elevated cortisol. prescription drugs will talk can used.
people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-
ups phone. things can take, feel like chronically
stressed veering toward negative effects stress many.
simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com

stressed less negative impact. don't list off
ways stress terrible chronic stress terrible think know. Insomnia,
immune system time will get battered won't able fight infection off
well, right? don't want stressed long. can start laying sort
classic pattern cortisol induced body fat. fact, whole literature related
comfort foods want consume comfort foods conditions chronic
stress. quite interesting actually, reveals something biology
chronic stress informative prevent it, regulate chronic
stress occurred. talk second comfort foods work
going refer work done impressive scientist name
Mary Dallman. work goes back decades. University California San
Francisco, asked question face seems kind obvious,
no mechanism known Mary lab personnel came along.
question was, seek high-fat high sugar foods
stressed awhile? be? reason so-called
glucocorticoids cortisol glucocorticoid. caused mentioned
before, releasing hormones brain, ACTH pituitary, et cetera.
normally high levels glucocorticoid shut off releasing hormones brain
pituitary, shut so-called negative feedback loop. just like
testosterone estrogen get high read seen speak
neurons pituitary brain shut production estrogen
testosterone. cortisol levels get high, much cortisol floating around
bloodstream, negative feedback loop, brain pituitary shutdown,
CRH ACTH otherwise stimulate cortisol, cortisol levels go
down. beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress however, stress
lasts four seven days way think chronic stress
really actionable way, 'causes changes feedback loop
adrenals brain pituitary. now brain pituitary
respond high levels glucocorticoids cortisol releasing them. becomes
positive feedback loop bad actually gets right levels gene
regulation transcription translation. really don't want chronic stress,
cascade stress equals stress equals stress.
important learn turn off stress response. don't want elevated


long. one study Dallman colleagues stimulate
chronic stress increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. found subjects
increase consumption sugar fat. fact even eat lard sounds
disgusting, willing just eat fat sugar. led
sorts things like type two diabetes led dysfunction adrenal output, et
cetera. real key learn shut off stress response.
interesting thing is, dominant colleagues studies followed
work found system kicked motion long,
tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, turns body fat receives
neural innervation. Neurons actually talked body fats now body fat
releasing certain hormones, got adrenals releasing cortisol,
feeding back brain make want sugar fatty foods.
so-called comfort foods work. watch next time
experience stress. short-term stress, typically blocks hunger.
longer stress typically triggers hunger, particular so-called comfort
foods,

01:14:00 Bombesin: Energy Without Eating

sugary fatty foods. kind interesting short-term stress can actually
block hunger. activating interacting system called bombesin
system. Bombesin peptide hormone. think named sort reptiles
amphibians, excuse me, sort toad. think initially sequenced
toad later discovered humans. think Toad's Latin name
Bombina bombina, something sort. decided call thing
bombesin, reduces eating stress liberates bombesin makes want
eat less. chronic stress causes positive feedback changes, not
positive. calling positive amplify stress response
not good you. short-term stress great,

01:15:00 Stress Makes Hair Gray, & Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying

long-term stress really, really bad. bad effects stress can talk
won't list off many these, know many them, hear


them. really want know control guessing yes indeed
stress can make go gray. rates people go gray, meaning gray hair,
cases gray body hair well depend genetic factors. couple
ways can go gray. actually STEM cell, call niche every
follicle. STEM cells follicle can produce
given hair cell. actually peroxide groups. know hear bleaching
hair peroxide, least 80s thing, can use hydrogen
peroxide bleach things, can produce peroxide hair follicle,
will cause hairs go gray. addition pigmentation hair, just like pigmentation
skin controlled melanocytes, old friends, melanocytes. say old
friends 'cause previous episodes talked sunlight getting ample
sunlight can increase levels certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
reduce hunger. can improve testosterone estrogen levels
reasons that. Well, turns activation so-called sympathetic nervous
system, really just another name system liberates adrenaline
adrenals epinephrine brain drives depletion melanocytes hair stem
cells. indeed rate aging will undergo based genetics,
stress will make us go gray. paper look want read
came recently. Zang et al, Z H N G et al. Nature.
Fabulous journal, definitely one apex journals, 2020. paper showed
activation stress various forms will deplete melanocytes stem cells.
not worry ice bath, hard exercise breathing, increasing
levels stress point going make go gray. talking
chronic stress. want offset stress effects graying hair
can either practice helps regulate stress consistent
basis. something like non sleep deep breath, meditation. can get access
massages vacations great, practice keep stress clamps
not chronically elevated, will great well. another case
sunlight know stimulates melanocytes, not just skin, hair. getting
ample sunlight, practice regulate stress will offset stressed induced grain
hairs way stress induced depletion melanocytes. melanocytes sounds
lot like melanin right. anything involved pigmentation
brain body generally "melano"



01:18:05 Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha & Science

front word way another. chronic stress bad
effects epinephrine cortisol elevated long
question becomes course, well, chronic stress? know difference
chronic acute stress? keep chronic stress bay?
negative effects, didn't even list number ones, effects
depression, certainly correlate elevated cortisol. Thyroid hormone. Low
thyroid hormone associated depression. Mistimed thyroid, getting
light feeding exercise sleep consistent schedule
consistent ish going powerful thing can order buffer
negative effects mental health physical health matter.
things one can take supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.
may may know people Cushing's, chronically
elevated cortisol. prescription drugs will talk can used.
people dealing situation life gets stressful less stressful,
stressful less stressful. say, based data McEwen others,
Bob Sapolsky's Lab many years. say stress lasts day
two days, three days starting become chronic stress. really no strict
cutoff not measuring everybody's cortisol moment moment.
lab done experiments measure stress people time. People vary
tremendously ability really hard day fall deeply asleep.
going ultimate reset ability sleep well less undisturbed
night, although one two wake ups night, probably not going
detrimental provided not long, not viewing light wake-
ups phone. things can take, feel like chronically
stressed veering toward negative effects stress many.
simple things people can terms supplementation.
supplements course checked safety margins you,
going differ person person. responsible making sure
safe decide use them. One common ones Ashwagandha
powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. welcome go examine.com
zero cost can see so-called human effect matrix. Ashwagandha
many uses, used enhance power output athletes shown


modestly increase testosterone. shown modestly adjust things like low
density lipoprotein cholesterol, so-called bad cholesterol quotes. profound
effect anxiety shown nine studies. Nine peer reviewed independent
studies, mean funded organizations no vested interest answer.
strong effect cortisol itself. strong? decrease cortisol noted
humans 14.5 27.9% reduction otherwise healthy stressed humans.
great. Six studies. mentions significantly larger many
supplements. Now, people will say taking Ashwagandha chronically may not
good. heard that, can point specific studies indicate
exactly not good, please put comment section let know.
comment section YouTube best. studies referring explore
genders. number subjects reasonably high, 64 more. One six
months study, long-term studies. great, like see not just
acute study. males females lots different ages overweight non
overweight. blood draws cortisol going end well saliva
test. Saliva actually best way measure free cortisol. can also measure
ear wax turns sounds pretty gross kind is. nonetheless
cortisol will accumulate earwax saliva, free cortisol. six
quality studies, independently supported points significant,
know, 14.5 27.9% reductions otherwise healthy adults. somebody
dealing chronic stress, stressful period life want stave off
negative effects stress. Well ashwagandha may, want highlight, may
right you. also tend lower total cortisol interesting. can lower
depression somewhat minimal degree, can lower mentioned things
like low density lipoprotein. think ashwagandha comes kind heavy
hitter department. Now interesting also effects ashwagandha
downstream reducing chronic stress cortisol, 'cause cortisol many
effects, there're receptors cortisol body brain. just list
off quickly, not going list off study talk many subjects detail.
Again, can go examine.com want, just put Ashwagandha. See
reactive protein, marker sorts negative health effects. Cardiovascular
health, even macular degeneration notably reduced. Heart palpitations notably
reduced. serum T3 T4, old friends thyroid hormones previous
episode increased. Symptoms OCD decreased, obsessions


compulsion's right obsessions mind compulsions behavior.
lot things downstream reducing cortisol. Lowered heart rate, lowered
rates insomnia, slightly improved memory. be, don't know,
cortisol short term can increase memory, guessing increased sleep.
Decreased pain, increased quality know... Decreased reaction times, things
sort. list goes on, things stem downstream
decreased cortisol. one decide take ashwagandha order reduce
cortisol, given want cortisol early day energy throughout day,
time take probably later day evening. never heard
preventing sleep causing insomnia kind. certainly wasn't listed one
major effects examine.com. will take ashwagandha time time
chronically stressed, not sleeping well to. might think
knowledge sleep sleep protocols sleep perfectly every
night, unfortunately dog canine form sundowners,
dementia, much night, days. no way getting
solid night sleep lately. will supplement ashwagandha typically
take sleep maybe also last meal day, least two
hours go sleep. decide right you. dosages can
vary tremendously. just go buy bottle reputable brand.
