00:08:33 Choosing Mate

go headspace.com/specialoffer today. now conversation Doctor David
Buss. David, delighted here. followed work number years,
excited ask number questions super interesting topics
people select mates, lie, cheat, and, also behave well dance
call mate choice. - Yes, fortunately, well-behaving humans mix here. -
Good know. Just start off, perhaps just orient us little bit mate
choice. know, primary criteria studies show men women use
order select mates, both, shall call transient mates well lifetime mates?
- Right, well, critical distinction, people look long-term
committed mateship, like marriage partner long-term romantic relationship


different people look hookup casual sex, one night stand, even
brief affair. actually critical. wonder maybe just back second
just talk little bit theoretical framework understanding mate choice.
basically stems Darwin's theory sexual selection, people,
think evolution, think about, cliche like survival fittest
nature, red tooth claw. Darwin noticed phenomena
couldn't explained so-called survival selection, things like brilliant plumage
peacocks, sex differences, like in, know, stags, example, massive
antlers females species not. came theory
sexual selection, deals not evolution characteristics due
survival advantage, rather due mating advantage. identified two
causal processes mating advantage occur. One intrasexual
competition stereotyping, two stags locking horns combat victor
gaining sexual access female, loser ambling off broken antler dejected
low self-esteem needing psychotherapy perhaps, mate value improvement
therapy. logic whatever qualities led success same-sex battles,
qualities get passed greater numbers. see evolution,
change time increase frequency characteristics associated
winning these, Darwin called contest competition. know logic
general now involves things like species competing position
status hierarchies. anyway, intrasexual competition one, second
relevant question mate choice preferential mate choice,
second causal pathway. logic members one sex agree one
another, consensus qualities desired,
opposite sex possess desired qualities embody desired qualities,
mating advantage. get chosen, get preferred. lacking desired
qualities get banished, shunned, ignored, modern environment become incels.
logic simple, also powerful. whatever
qualities desired, consensually desired, heritable basis those,
increase frequency time. so, human case, two causal
processes sexual selection related other, preferences, mate
preferences one sex basically set ground rules competition opposite sex.
if, example, hypothetically women preferred mate men able
willing devote resources them, create competition among men


claw way, know, beat men resource acquisition,
displaying willingness commit particular woman.
women though. One interesting things humans mutual mate
choice, not true species. not just matter of, know,
selecting someone mate, reciprocally select you.
mutual mate choice, preferences, mate preferences, women
have, mate preferences men have, consequently competition among men
access desirable women competition among women access
desirable man.

00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires

sort little bit theoretical backdrop. asked, well,
qualities men women desire, maybe start long-term mating,
shift short-term mating. long-term mating interesting
rare mammalian world. 5,000 species primates
which, sorry, 5,000 species mammals, one,
percentage mammals anything resembling like pair bond long-term
mating strategy, 3-5%. extremely rare. even closest primate
relatives, chimpanzees, don't long-term mating strategy. don't
anything resembling pair bond mating. chimps, females come estrus,
almost sexual activity occurs estrous phase. that, males
females basically ignore part, exceptions.
humans, evolution long-term pair bonding, attachment, heavy male
investment offspring, relatively concealed ovulation. kind
unique aspects human mating system. get question,
qualities? best, large scale study done this, study
back 37 different cultures. now replicated
researchers, basically found three clusters things. found qualities
men women wanted long-term mate. found qualities
sex differentiated, women prefer men men prefer
women. found attributes highly variable across
cultures whether people found desirable indispensable irrelevant,
mate. give examples these. - Yeah, great.


love know common themes across cultures terms
mate sexually select for. - Yeah, things were,
talk universal desires, things men women share. things
like intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction love, really kind
heartwarming people think love recent western invention
European poets, turns not true. can go Kung San
Botswana, describe pretty much experience falling love
do. even describe distinction kind infatuation stage love
attachment phase where, can't maintain frenzy infatuation obsession
long, six weeks, maybe six months most, otherwise can get nothing else
done life. dopamine circuits firing high frequency. - Yeah,
mutual attraction, love, good health, dependability, emotional stability, although
bit sex difference women preferring bit men.
basically, may seem obvious. no one wants stupid, mean, ugly, disease-
ridden mate. perhaps obvious, but, no one knew advance 37
culture study. universal preferences. go Zulu tribe
South Africa or, know, Rio de Janeiro Brazil Portugal Oslo, anywhere
world, qualities people universally desire long-term mates. Sex
differences. sex differences basically fell two clusters. women men
prioritized good earning capacity, slightly older age, qualities associated
resource acquisition. things like man's social status. drive?
ambitious? good long-term resource trajectory one way
like phrase it, women often don't look necessarily

00:18:31 Women & Men Seek Long-Term Mates

resources guy possesses moment, trajectory? - Just
sorry interrupt, may ask, anything known commonalities
assessed? know, it, know, rolling bed early running eight
miles, showing proficiency school, handles well socially parties, isn't
drinking much, knows when, obviously integrating multiple cues, brain
complex place, information variables across
cultures? - Yeah, well think less attention that, great
question. One things know across cultures women attend


attention structure. attention structure key determine status. people
high status people pay attention. -
attention others them, not well given potential mate can focus pay
attention, necessarily. - Yeah, exactly. And, women look, mean, know,
guy, even modern environment, guy spending eight hours day playing video
games, eating Cheetos drinking beer, devoting effort professional
development? hard work, ambition. clear goals
existential crisis not knowing going life?
qualities people look for. also women use called literature,
mate choice copying. related part attention structure, is, guys
passed filters multiple women. like, pre-approved men.
done studies just take guy, photograph alone versus, take
guy, put attractive woman next him, put two women next him,
women judge exactly guy much attractive, paired
women, not. guys exploit modern world hiring wing
women go dates forth, sister former girlfriend
whatever. So, correct in, women use multiple cues assess
things, change time. know, so, modern environment, even
things like attention structure, guy million Twitter followers
three Twitter followers. index attention structure hence status
guy within broader community. So, evolutionary perspective,
reasonable women prioritize qualities tremendous
asymmetry reproductive biology, namely fertilization occurs internally within
women, not within men, women bear burdens nine month pregnancy,
metabolically expensive, well creating opportunity costs terms mobility and,
solving tasks people need solve course lives. one
way phrase costs making bad mate choice much heavier
women comes sexual behavior certainly, because, benefits
correspondingly making wise mate choice higher women sexual
context. said, mutual mate choice species. men
value women? Physical attractiveness. - ranked
important criteria women men? - Yes, exactly. - Consistently across
cultures? - Consistently, not women indifferent it. women pay
attention guy's physical appearance, fitness forth, guys actually


off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful

00:08:33 Choosing Mate

go headspace.com/specialoffer today. now conversation Doctor David
Buss. David, delighted here. followed work number years,
excited ask number questions super interesting topics
people select mates, lie, cheat, and, also behave well dance
call mate choice. - Yes, fortunately, well-behaving humans mix here. -
Good know. Just start off, perhaps just orient us little bit mate
choice. know, primary criteria studies show men women use
order select mates, both, shall call transient mates well lifetime mates?
- Right, well, critical distinction, people look long-term
committed mateship, like marriage partner long-term romantic relationship


different people look hookup casual sex, one night stand, even
brief affair. actually critical. wonder maybe just back second
just talk little bit theoretical framework understanding mate choice.
basically stems Darwin's theory sexual selection, people,
think evolution, think about, cliche like survival fittest
nature, red tooth claw. Darwin noticed phenomena
couldn't explained so-called survival selection, things like brilliant plumage
peacocks, sex differences, like in, know, stags, example, massive
antlers females species not. came theory
sexual selection, deals not evolution characteristics due
survival advantage, rather due mating advantage. identified two
causal processes mating advantage occur. One intrasexual
competition stereotyping, two stags locking horns combat victor
gaining sexual access female, loser ambling off broken antler dejected
low self-esteem needing psychotherapy perhaps, mate value improvement
therapy. logic whatever qualities led success same-sex battles,
qualities get passed greater numbers. see evolution,
change time increase frequency characteristics associated
winning these, Darwin called contest competition. know logic
general now involves things like species competing position
status hierarchies. anyway, intrasexual competition one, second
relevant question mate choice preferential mate choice,
second causal pathway. logic members one sex agree one
another, consensus qualities desired,
opposite sex possess desired qualities embody desired qualities,
mating advantage. get chosen, get preferred. lacking desired
qualities get banished, shunned, ignored, modern environment become incels.
logic simple, also powerful. whatever
qualities desired, consensually desired, heritable basis those,
increase frequency time. so, human case, two causal
processes sexual selection related other, preferences, mate
preferences one sex basically set ground rules competition opposite sex.
if, example, hypothetically women preferred mate men able
willing devote resources them, create competition among men


claw way, know, beat men resource acquisition,
displaying willingness commit particular woman.
women though. One interesting things humans mutual mate
choice, not true species. not just matter of, know,
selecting someone mate, reciprocally select you.
mutual mate choice, preferences, mate preferences, women
have, mate preferences men have, consequently competition among men
access desirable women competition among women access
desirable man.

00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires

sort little bit theoretical backdrop. asked, well,
qualities men women desire, maybe start long-term mating,
shift short-term mating. long-term mating interesting
rare mammalian world. 5,000 species primates
which, sorry, 5,000 species mammals, one,
percentage mammals anything resembling like pair bond long-term
mating strategy, 3-5%. extremely rare. even closest primate
relatives, chimpanzees, don't long-term mating strategy. don't
anything resembling pair bond mating. chimps, females come estrus,
almost sexual activity occurs estrous phase. that, males
females basically ignore part, exceptions.
humans, evolution long-term pair bonding, attachment, heavy male
investment offspring, relatively concealed ovulation. kind
unique aspects human mating system. get question,
qualities? best, large scale study done this, study
back 37 different cultures. now replicated
researchers, basically found three clusters things. found qualities
men women wanted long-term mate. found qualities
sex differentiated, women prefer men men prefer
women. found attributes highly variable across
cultures whether people found desirable indispensable irrelevant,
mate. give examples these. - Yeah, great.


love know common themes across cultures terms
mate sexually select for. - Yeah, things were,
talk universal desires, things men women share. things
like intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction love, really kind
heartwarming people think love recent western invention
European poets, turns not true. can go Kung San
Botswana, describe pretty much experience falling love
do. even describe distinction kind infatuation stage love
attachment phase where, can't maintain frenzy infatuation obsession
long, six weeks, maybe six months most, otherwise can get nothing else
done life. dopamine circuits firing high frequency. - Yeah,
mutual attraction, love, good health, dependability, emotional stability, although
bit sex difference women preferring bit men.
basically, may seem obvious. no one wants stupid, mean, ugly, disease-
ridden mate. perhaps obvious, but, no one knew advance 37
culture study. universal preferences. go Zulu tribe
South Africa or, know, Rio de Janeiro Brazil Portugal Oslo, anywhere
world, qualities people universally desire long-term mates. Sex
differences. sex differences basically fell two clusters. women men
prioritized good earning capacity, slightly older age, qualities associated
resource acquisition. things like man's social status. drive?
ambitious? good long-term resource trajectory one way
like phrase it, women often don't look necessarily

00:18:31 Women & Men Seek Long-Term Mates

resources guy possesses moment, trajectory? - Just
sorry interrupt, may ask, anything known commonalities
assessed? know, it, know, rolling bed early running eight
miles, showing proficiency school, handles well socially parties, isn't
drinking much, knows when, obviously integrating multiple cues, brain
complex place, information variables across
cultures? - Yeah, well think less attention that, great
question. One things know across cultures women attend


attention structure. attention structure key determine status. people
high status people pay attention. -
attention others them, not well given potential mate can focus pay
attention, necessarily. - Yeah, exactly. And, women look, mean, know,
guy, even modern environment, guy spending eight hours day playing video
games, eating Cheetos drinking beer, devoting effort professional
development? hard work, ambition. clear goals
existential crisis not knowing going life?
qualities people look for. also women use called literature,
mate choice copying. related part attention structure, is, guys
passed filters multiple women. like, pre-approved men.
done studies just take guy, photograph alone versus, take
guy, put attractive woman next him, put two women next him,
women judge exactly guy much attractive, paired
women, not. guys exploit modern world hiring wing
women go dates forth, sister former girlfriend
whatever. So, correct in, women use multiple cues assess
things, change time. know, so, modern environment, even
things like attention structure, guy million Twitter followers
three Twitter followers. index attention structure hence status
guy within broader community. So, evolutionary perspective,
reasonable women prioritize qualities tremendous
asymmetry reproductive biology, namely fertilization occurs internally within
women, not within men, women bear burdens nine month pregnancy,
metabolically expensive, well creating opportunity costs terms mobility and,
solving tasks people need solve course lives. one
way phrase costs making bad mate choice much heavier
women comes sexual behavior certainly, because, benefits
correspondingly making wise mate choice higher women sexual
context. said, mutual mate choice species. men
value women? Physical attractiveness. - ranked
important criteria women men? - Yes, exactly. - Consistently across
cultures? - Consistently, not women indifferent it. women pay
attention guy's physical appearance, fitness forth, guys actually


off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.

oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms

different people look hookup casual sex, one night stand, even
brief affair. actually critical. wonder maybe just back second
just talk little bit theoretical framework understanding mate choice.
basically stems Darwin's theory sexual selection, people,
think evolution, think about, cliche like survival fittest
nature, red tooth claw. Darwin noticed phenomena
couldn't explained so-called survival selection, things like brilliant plumage
peacocks, sex differences, like in, know, stags, example, massive
antlers females species not. came theory
sexual selection, deals not evolution characteristics due
survival advantage, rather due mating advantage. identified two
causal processes mating advantage occur. One intrasexual
competition stereotyping, two stags locking horns combat victor
gaining sexual access female, loser ambling off broken antler dejected
low self-esteem needing psychotherapy perhaps, mate value improvement
therapy. logic whatever qualities led success same-sex battles,
qualities get passed greater numbers. see evolution,
change time increase frequency characteristics associated
winning these, Darwin called contest competition. know logic
general now involves things like species competing position
status hierarchies. anyway, intrasexual competition one, second
relevant question mate choice preferential mate choice,
second causal pathway. logic members one sex agree one
another, consensus qualities desired,
opposite sex possess desired qualities embody desired qualities,
mating advantage. get chosen, get preferred. lacking desired
qualities get banished, shunned, ignored, modern environment become incels.
logic simple, also powerful. whatever
qualities desired, consensually desired, heritable basis those,
increase frequency time. so, human case, two causal
processes sexual selection related other, preferences, mate
preferences one sex basically set ground rules competition opposite sex.
if, example, hypothetically women preferred mate men able
willing devote resources them, create competition among men


claw way, know, beat men resource acquisition,
displaying willingness commit particular woman.
women though. One interesting things humans mutual mate
choice, not true species. not just matter of, know,
selecting someone mate, reciprocally select you.
mutual mate choice, preferences, mate preferences, women
have, mate preferences men have, consequently competition among men
access desirable women competition among women access
desirable man.

00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires

sort little bit theoretical backdrop. asked, well,
qualities men women desire, maybe start long-term mating,
shift short-term mating. long-term mating interesting
rare mammalian world. 5,000 species primates
which, sorry, 5,000 species mammals, one,
percentage mammals anything resembling like pair bond long-term
mating strategy, 3-5%. extremely rare. even closest primate
relatives, chimpanzees, don't long-term mating strategy. don't
anything resembling pair bond mating. chimps, females come estrus,
almost sexual activity occurs estrous phase. that, males
females basically ignore part, exceptions.
humans, evolution long-term pair bonding, attachment, heavy male
investment offspring, relatively concealed ovulation. kind
unique aspects human mating system. get question,
qualities? best, large scale study done this, study
back 37 different cultures. now replicated
researchers, basically found three clusters things. found qualities
men women wanted long-term mate. found qualities
sex differentiated, women prefer men men prefer
women. found attributes highly variable across
cultures whether people found desirable indispensable irrelevant,
mate. give examples these. - Yeah, great.


love know common themes across cultures terms
mate sexually select for. - Yeah, things were,
talk universal desires, things men women share. things
like intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction love, really kind
heartwarming people think love recent western invention
European poets, turns not true. can go Kung San
Botswana, describe pretty much experience falling love
do. even describe distinction kind infatuation stage love
attachment phase where, can't maintain frenzy infatuation obsession
long, six weeks, maybe six months most, otherwise can get nothing else
done life. dopamine circuits firing high frequency. - Yeah,
mutual attraction, love, good health, dependability, emotional stability, although
bit sex difference women preferring bit men.
basically, may seem obvious. no one wants stupid, mean, ugly, disease-
ridden mate. perhaps obvious, but, no one knew advance 37
culture study. universal preferences. go Zulu tribe
South Africa or, know, Rio de Janeiro Brazil Portugal Oslo, anywhere
world, qualities people universally desire long-term mates. Sex
differences. sex differences basically fell two clusters. women men
prioritized good earning capacity, slightly older age, qualities associated
resource acquisition. things like man's social status. drive?
ambitious? good long-term resource trajectory one way
like phrase it, women often don't look necessarily

00:18:31 Women & Men Seek Long-Term Mates

resources guy possesses moment, trajectory? - Just
sorry interrupt, may ask, anything known commonalities
assessed? know, it, know, rolling bed early running eight
miles, showing proficiency school, handles well socially parties, isn't
drinking much, knows when, obviously integrating multiple cues, brain
complex place, information variables across
cultures? - Yeah, well think less attention that, great
question. One things know across cultures women attend


attention structure. attention structure key determine status. people
high status people pay attention. -
attention others them, not well given potential mate can focus pay
attention, necessarily. - Yeah, exactly. And, women look, mean, know,
guy, even modern environment, guy spending eight hours day playing video
games, eating Cheetos drinking beer, devoting effort professional
development? hard work, ambition. clear goals
existential crisis not knowing going life?
qualities people look for. also women use called literature,
mate choice copying. related part attention structure, is, guys
passed filters multiple women. like, pre-approved men.
done studies just take guy, photograph alone versus, take
guy, put attractive woman next him, put two women next him,
women judge exactly guy much attractive, paired
women, not. guys exploit modern world hiring wing
women go dates forth, sister former girlfriend
whatever. So, correct in, women use multiple cues assess
things, change time. know, so, modern environment, even
things like attention structure, guy million Twitter followers
three Twitter followers. index attention structure hence status
guy within broader community. So, evolutionary perspective,
reasonable women prioritize qualities tremendous
asymmetry reproductive biology, namely fertilization occurs internally within
women, not within men, women bear burdens nine month pregnancy,
metabolically expensive, well creating opportunity costs terms mobility and,
solving tasks people need solve course lives. one
way phrase costs making bad mate choice much heavier
women comes sexual behavior certainly, because, benefits
correspondingly making wise mate choice higher women sexual
context. said, mutual mate choice species. men
value women? Physical attractiveness. - ranked
important criteria women men? - Yes, exactly. - Consistently across
cultures? - Consistently, not women indifferent it. women pay
attention guy's physical appearance, fitness forth, guys actually


off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy

extremely interesting topics today, last not least, thank interest

claw way, know, beat men resource acquisition,
displaying willingness commit particular woman.
women though. One interesting things humans mutual mate
choice, not true species. not just matter of, know,
selecting someone mate, reciprocally select you.
mutual mate choice, preferences, mate preferences, women
have, mate preferences men have, consequently competition among men
access desirable women competition among women access
desirable man.

00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires

sort little bit theoretical backdrop. asked, well,
qualities men women desire, maybe start long-term mating,
shift short-term mating. long-term mating interesting
rare mammalian world. 5,000 species primates
which, sorry, 5,000 species mammals, one,
percentage mammals anything resembling like pair bond long-term
mating strategy, 3-5%. extremely rare. even closest primate
relatives, chimpanzees, don't long-term mating strategy. don't
anything resembling pair bond mating. chimps, females come estrus,
almost sexual activity occurs estrous phase. that, males
females basically ignore part, exceptions.
humans, evolution long-term pair bonding, attachment, heavy male
investment offspring, relatively concealed ovulation. kind
unique aspects human mating system. get question,
qualities? best, large scale study done this, study
back 37 different cultures. now replicated
researchers, basically found three clusters things. found qualities
men women wanted long-term mate. found qualities
sex differentiated, women prefer men men prefer
women. found attributes highly variable across
cultures whether people found desirable indispensable irrelevant,
mate. give examples these. - Yeah, great.


love know common themes across cultures terms
mate sexually select for. - Yeah, things were,
talk universal desires, things men women share. things
like intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction love, really kind
heartwarming people think love recent western invention
European poets, turns not true. can go Kung San
Botswana, describe pretty much experience falling love
do. even describe distinction kind infatuation stage love
attachment phase where, can't maintain frenzy infatuation obsession
long, six weeks, maybe six months most, otherwise can get nothing else
done life. dopamine circuits firing high frequency. - Yeah,
mutual attraction, love, good health, dependability, emotional stability, although
bit sex difference women preferring bit men.
basically, may seem obvious. no one wants stupid, mean, ugly, disease-
ridden mate. perhaps obvious, but, no one knew advance 37
culture study. universal preferences. go Zulu tribe
South Africa or, know, Rio de Janeiro Brazil Portugal Oslo, anywhere
world, qualities people universally desire long-term mates. Sex
differences. sex differences basically fell two clusters. women men
prioritized good earning capacity, slightly older age, qualities associated
resource acquisition. things like man's social status. drive?
ambitious? good long-term resource trajectory one way
like phrase it, women often don't look necessarily

00:18:31 Women & Men Seek Long-Term Mates

resources guy possesses moment, trajectory? - Just
sorry interrupt, may ask, anything known commonalities
assessed? know, it, know, rolling bed early running eight
miles, showing proficiency school, handles well socially parties, isn't
drinking much, knows when, obviously integrating multiple cues, brain
complex place, information variables across
cultures? - Yeah, well think less attention that, great
question. One things know across cultures women attend


attention structure. attention structure key determine status. people
high status people pay attention. -
attention others them, not well given potential mate can focus pay
attention, necessarily. - Yeah, exactly. And, women look, mean, know,
guy, even modern environment, guy spending eight hours day playing video
games, eating Cheetos drinking beer, devoting effort professional
development? hard work, ambition. clear goals
existential crisis not knowing going life?
qualities people look for. also women use called literature,
mate choice copying. related part attention structure, is, guys
passed filters multiple women. like, pre-approved men.
done studies just take guy, photograph alone versus, take
guy, put attractive woman next him, put two women next him,
women judge exactly guy much attractive, paired
women, not. guys exploit modern world hiring wing
women go dates forth, sister former girlfriend
whatever. So, correct in, women use multiple cues assess
things, change time. know, so, modern environment, even
things like attention structure, guy million Twitter followers
three Twitter followers. index attention structure hence status
guy within broader community. So, evolutionary perspective,
reasonable women prioritize qualities tremendous
asymmetry reproductive biology, namely fertilization occurs internally within
women, not within men, women bear burdens nine month pregnancy,
metabolically expensive, well creating opportunity costs terms mobility and,
solving tasks people need solve course lives. one
way phrase costs making bad mate choice much heavier
women comes sexual behavior certainly, because, benefits
correspondingly making wise mate choice higher women sexual
context. said, mutual mate choice species. men
value women? Physical attractiveness. - ranked
important criteria women men? - Yes, exactly. - Consistently across
cultures? - Consistently, not women indifferent it. women pay
attention guy's physical appearance, fitness forth, guys actually


off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think

love know common themes across cultures terms
mate sexually select for. - Yeah, things were,
talk universal desires, things men women share. things
like intelligence, kindness, mutual attraction love, really kind
heartwarming people think love recent western invention
European poets, turns not true. can go Kung San
Botswana, describe pretty much experience falling love
do. even describe distinction kind infatuation stage love
attachment phase where, can't maintain frenzy infatuation obsession
long, six weeks, maybe six months most, otherwise can get nothing else
done life. dopamine circuits firing high frequency. - Yeah,
mutual attraction, love, good health, dependability, emotional stability, although
bit sex difference women preferring bit men.
basically, may seem obvious. no one wants stupid, mean, ugly, disease-
ridden mate. perhaps obvious, but, no one knew advance 37
culture study. universal preferences. go Zulu tribe
South Africa or, know, Rio de Janeiro Brazil Portugal Oslo, anywhere
world, qualities people universally desire long-term mates. Sex
differences. sex differences basically fell two clusters. women men
prioritized good earning capacity, slightly older age, qualities associated
resource acquisition. things like man's social status. drive?
ambitious? good long-term resource trajectory one way
like phrase it, women often don't look necessarily

00:18:31 Women & Men Seek Long-Term Mates

resources guy possesses moment, trajectory? - Just
sorry interrupt, may ask, anything known commonalities
assessed? know, it, know, rolling bed early running eight
miles, showing proficiency school, handles well socially parties, isn't
drinking much, knows when, obviously integrating multiple cues, brain
complex place, information variables across
cultures? - Yeah, well think less attention that, great
question. One things know across cultures women attend


attention structure. attention structure key determine status. people
high status people pay attention. -
attention others them, not well given potential mate can focus pay
attention, necessarily. - Yeah, exactly. And, women look, mean, know,
guy, even modern environment, guy spending eight hours day playing video
games, eating Cheetos drinking beer, devoting effort professional
development? hard work, ambition. clear goals
existential crisis not knowing going life?
qualities people look for. also women use called literature,
mate choice copying. related part attention structure, is, guys
passed filters multiple women. like, pre-approved men.
done studies just take guy, photograph alone versus, take
guy, put attractive woman next him, put two women next him,
women judge exactly guy much attractive, paired
women, not. guys exploit modern world hiring wing
women go dates forth, sister former girlfriend
whatever. So, correct in, women use multiple cues assess
things, change time. know, so, modern environment, even
things like attention structure, guy million Twitter followers
three Twitter followers. index attention structure hence status
guy within broader community. So, evolutionary perspective,
reasonable women prioritize qualities tremendous
asymmetry reproductive biology, namely fertilization occurs internally within
women, not within men, women bear burdens nine month pregnancy,
metabolically expensive, well creating opportunity costs terms mobility and,
solving tasks people need solve course lives. one
way phrase costs making bad mate choice much heavier
women comes sexual behavior certainly, because, benefits
correspondingly making wise mate choice higher women sexual
context. said, mutual mate choice species. men
value women? Physical attractiveness. - ranked
important criteria women men? - Yes, exactly. - Consistently across
cultures? - Consistently, not women indifferent it. women pay
attention guy's physical appearance, fitness forth, guys actually


off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth

attention structure. attention structure key determine status. people
high status people pay attention. -
attention others them, not well given potential mate can focus pay
attention, necessarily. - Yeah, exactly. And, women look, mean, know,
guy, even modern environment, guy spending eight hours day playing video
games, eating Cheetos drinking beer, devoting effort professional
development? hard work, ambition. clear goals
existential crisis not knowing going life?
qualities people look for. also women use called literature,
mate choice copying. related part attention structure, is, guys
passed filters multiple women. like, pre-approved men.
done studies just take guy, photograph alone versus, take
guy, put attractive woman next him, put two women next him,
women judge exactly guy much attractive, paired
women, not. guys exploit modern world hiring wing
women go dates forth, sister former girlfriend
whatever. So, correct in, women use multiple cues assess
things, change time. know, so, modern environment, even
things like attention structure, guy million Twitter followers
three Twitter followers. index attention structure hence status
guy within broader community. So, evolutionary perspective,
reasonable women prioritize qualities tremendous
asymmetry reproductive biology, namely fertilization occurs internally within
women, not within men, women bear burdens nine month pregnancy,
metabolically expensive, well creating opportunity costs terms mobility and,
solving tasks people need solve course lives. one
way phrase costs making bad mate choice much heavier
women comes sexual behavior certainly, because, benefits
correspondingly making wise mate choice higher women sexual
context. said, mutual mate choice species. men
value women? Physical attractiveness. - ranked
important criteria women men? - Yes, exactly. - Consistently across
cultures? - Consistently, not women indifferent it. women pay
attention guy's physical appearance, fitness forth, guys actually


off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people

off base thinking women prefer muscular men actually do. like
muscle magazines, men bulging biceps forth, women don't find
especially, prioritize fit men, good shoulder hip ratio qualities
physical appearance, well things like cues health. physical appearance
provides wealth information person's health status, also provides
men wealth information woman's fertility, reproductive value. Now not
men think consciously. mean, men don't walk street see
woman say, oh, find attractive think must fertile. Maybe
weird people that, men just like, just find cues attractive.
cues cues associated youth health know youth
powerful cue fertility reproductive value. men prioritize physical
appearance, field psychology, taught undergraduate
can't judge book cover, physical attractiveness infinitely
arbitrary, infinitely culturally variable. simply not true. know now based
last 20 years scientific studies, cues men find attractive women not
arbitrary. variation across cultures, like relative plumpness versus
thinness, things like clear skin, clear eyes, symmetrical features, low waist hip
ratio, full lips, lustrous hair, qualities associated youth
health, hence heavy evolved part standards attractiveness.
so, not just men superficial creatures evaluate women
basis appearance, underlying logic so.

00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History

said, relative youth, age thing one largest sex differences
find long-term mate selection, women preferring somewhat older men, men
preferring somewhat younger women. consistent age gap relate
statement? - Yes, is. age gap though depends age man. So,
can document this, studies, found men preferred women
three four years younger average. qualify
second. Women preferred guys three half four
half years older were. sex difference going opposite
direction. men get older, prefer women increasingly younger
are. one way gauge this, actual marriage statistics,


expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank
you. Well, delight talk hope engage research

expressed preferences, sexes kind converge. look at,
know, first marriage, second marriage, third marriage, people get divorced
remarried. Average age gap is, America anyway, three years first marriage
guys older, five years second marriage, eight years third marriage.
is, men getting older getting divorced remarried,
marrying women increasingly younger are. terms preferences,
also expressed preferences. doesn't go down, like a, say 25-year-old
man say, prefer woman 20 early 20s, 35-year-old man might
prefer woman late 20s early 30s. 50-year-old man might prefer
woman say, 35 38. preferences go up, gap gets increasingly
larger. reason don't see things like, aren't men preferring women?
peak fertility humans around age 24, 25. say, well, aren't 60-
year-old men prioritizing 25-year-old women? Well, mentioned, reciprocal
mutual mate choice phenomenon. - constraints equation. - Well, constrains
it, also marriage long-term mating things reproductive unions
modern environment. they're, know, supposed things
couple. get large age gap, essentially different cultures.
grow different songs, cultural gap gets large, don't
understand other. So, constraints that, look contexts
no constraints sort, historically kings, emperors, despots, et
cetera, give one modern example, basically prefer young, fertile,
attractive females. harems, stock harems those,
circulate 30, forth. look marriage systems
unconstrained, preferences likely revealed, within cultures.
is, look men position get want. Mick
Jagger noted, can't always get want, try sometimes, get
need. - hear time got needed, - got
wanted, maybe needed, position. don't know still is,
seventies now, position was, say, Rod Stewart, take
another example, Leonardo DiCaprio. male position
thousands women potentially available you, can pick,
see clearer expression younger females. chart
floating around internet girlfriends Leonardo DiCaprio got older.
getting older older, graph age girlfriends, basically


stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.

stayed same, early twenties so. - values consistency. -
Consistency. But, anyway, data converge that. universal sex
differences long-term mate selection. now shift to, mention
cultural variability, critical thing, 37 culture study,
found preference virginity, no prior sexual experience,
variable desire across cultures. cultures, like time
study, China, basically indispensable partner virgin.
end, Sweden Swedes typically place close zero value it,
even find undesirable. Like, weird virgin.
whole spectrum. - virginity female, also, China preference
male female virgins? mutual mate selection? - Yeah,
preference sexes. - Interesting. - good question,
sex difference, always direction males preferring virginity
females, gone back China. still research China among
places. gone back retested modern urban populations,
importance virginity gone China, especially urban areas,
sex difference didn't exist before, now emerged, males value
females. think part previous times, hit ceiling effects, know,
sexes say, yeah, absolutely important Virgin. So, cultural
variation cultural change time qualities. sex
differences described remained invariant years. since 37
culture study, replicated in, least couple dozen different cultures,
gone back cultures. mentioned, gone back
China, Brazil, India, look cultural changes time, been,
know, cases, dramatic cultural changes time.

00:32:20 Deception Courtship

sex differences described invariant. haven't changed bit. -
remiss didn't ask truth telling deception, measures
describing, age, instance, one can potentially lie about, right?
guessing people online profiles whatnot.
understand, people also lie height features online profiles,
much harder hide, right? Eventually truth comes some, not


things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms

things. So, would, tell us men women
leverage deception versus truth telling communicating things around
mate choice selection? - Yeah, well, basically men women deceive,
modern cultural invention online dating, which, know, little-used
10 years ago, virtually absent 20 years ago. people lie, lie
predictable ways. lie ways attempt embody mate preferences
person trying attract. men lie. deceive income,
status. exaggerate income 20%. tack two inches
height. five ten, round six feet. don't like,
five ten, don't say gigantic, kind round
desirable direction. Women tend deceive weight. tend shave
15 pounds off reported weight, sexes post photos not truly
representative actually look like. might post photos
younger, even advice, tips create best selfie,
best angle, will maximally, know, enhance look like. - just
doctoring photos guessing. - Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely. one
things now, say, well, people find out, course, people find out.
just give one story colleague mine, male, internet
dating. picked women self-described sevens one seven
attractiveness. attractive, self-reported, se went one
woman, missing front teeth. said, well, call picky,
missing front teeth. thinks like top attractiveness, little
disappointed that. women course disappointed, meet guy
think physically fit, know, athletic guy, comes he's, know,
300 pounds overweight. people find out. internet dating
sites kind vetting accuracy something. things can look
public records, guy criminal record, example,
a, know, sexual offenders website? things can verify.
tell people is, really meet person interact, know,
part deception, also happens internet dating
photograph tends overwhelm cues cues
written statements. weren't really evolved process written statements,
evolved respond physical cues, but, men tend attend visual cues
much women. women mate selection, olfactory cues


guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank
you. Well, delight talk hope engage research

guy sound like? vocal qualities, auditory cues, olfactory
cues, smell like? women acute sense smell
men do. guy doesn't smell right, even embodies
qualities women want, deal breaker. encourage people just, know,
stop hundred texts back forth messaging, meet person cup
coffee interact. you'll, know, get accurate bead
person. course, qualities can't assess even half-hour
interaction, can tell lot, things like emotional stability, things
assessed time. one things advise people do,

00:37:30 Emotional Stability

not advice-giving business, people ask time. find
study, say, well, got problem, can give advice? one
things assess, things like emotional stability, absolutely critical long-term
mating, something like go trip together, take vacation even
unfamiliar environment cope things not familiar
with. opposed environment predictable, get
greater exposure, one hallmarks emotional instability
respond stress. emotionally unstable people tend long latency return
baseline stressful event. sort information can't get
coffee date, can get assessing time. - Somebody whose laboratory
studies stress tools combat stress.

00:38:40 Lying Long-Term Interest

great, yet incentive people develop self-regulatory mechanisms
themselves. guessing many features deception context present
long internet dating. it, somewhat dark think about, is,
deception built dance call mate selection? built
long time, something think emerged people
approaching electronic, web-based mediums? - mean,
forms deception long time human evolutionary history.
one form deception, haven't mentioned deception whether


interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.

interested long-term committed relationship short-term hookup.
deception that, especially part men. men interested, like
Tinder, reported, although Tinder denies this, reported
something like 30% men Tinder, either married long-term committed
relationships, looking something side, terms successfully
attracting mate, overt display that, hey interested just short-term hookup.
interested sex, want sex right now. just go back apartment.
ineffective tactics. effective tactics men often displaying
cues long-term interests. so, course effective woman
seeking long-term interest. so, deception. find studies
deception, men tend exaggerate depths feelings woman,
exaggerate similar are, aligned values religious
orientations political values forth. so, think deception around
that, think probably evolutionarily recurrent form deception women
defenses way. think modern internet dating opens door
certain types deception, minimum, difficult accomplish
ancestrally. like things like Photoshopping, know, wasn't available back then.
plus evolved context small group living, not
personal observations someone's qualities, also relatives, friends,
allies, social reputation someone had. critical sources
information less available modern environments because, know, people
migrate, move place place. can close one internet profile
put another, six going simultaneously. modern environment
opens door forms deception weren't available weren't available
degree, ancestrally.

00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects

- see. interesting. mind touching features
selected for, terms sexual partner choice? talked little bit mate choice,
terms sexual partner choice, good studies exploring people
selecting for, just state pure hypothalamic drive?
neuroscientist, all. therefore hard recreate laboratory. - Well, no,
no. know something that, know something


preferences sex partner differ preference long-term mate.
overlap course, one thing physical appearance. physical appearance
women important long-term mating, not important men, becomes
important short-term mating. guy good-looking?
physical attributes important women. are, remain important
men, physical appearance short-term mating, footnote men
willing drop standards short-term mating, low commitment, low risk, just
sex, without entangling commitments. Women likely prioritize call bad
boy qualities. guys self-confident, guys strut, guys
little arrogant, guys risk-taking, guys defy conventions, women
attracted guys short-term mating long-term mating. whereas long-
term mating, go good dad qualities. guy dependable?
going good father children? also short-term mating women use
mate-copying heuristic. is, thousands women find
attractive, women find attractive. groupie
phenomenon. So, rock stars, example, thousands screaming
women, want sleep famous rock star. use
information find, took like still photo rock stars asked
women attractive guy is, versus tell 'em famous rock star showed
thousands women screaming him, judge entirely differently, terms
attractiveness. even, important point women's attraction
men context specific, varies across contexts, men's attraction
women. give just example that. female colleague mine
went conference, academic conference, found organizer
conference really attractive, saw six months later wondered,
well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.
organizer, center attention structure. know,
guy stage directing everybody everyone attending him.
just normal presenter conference, didn't command attention
structure like organizer. just illustration
circumstance-dependent women's mate attraction guys. depends on, know,
status, number women attracted him, attention structure,
interacts puppy, baby. ignoring baby distress positively
interacting young child. things, whereas men, almost doesn't


matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank
you. Well, delight talk hope engage research

well, thinking? doesn't seem attractive all.

matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.

matter. Context irrelevant.

00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching

honing specific psychophysical cues woman displaying,
context damned. - interesting. talk infidelity committed
relationships. consistent findings around reasons for, maybe
even long-term consequences infidelity men women,
marriage, long-term partnership, or, know, infidelity kind, suppose.
guessing happen. frequent it? - Yeah, interesting thing. Well,
frequent is, difficult gauge because, one forms human conduct
people like keep secret. So, go back now say 70 years classic Kinsey
studies, questions infidelity questions people refused
answer. question brought up, caused people drop
study. kind tells something that, mean, people conceal?
know, infidelity, incest, murder, small handful things people
universally want conceal, infidelity one them. So, people it.
Kinsey estimated 26% married women committed infidelity point
marriage, 50% men. studies given lower figures.
exact figures bounce around, depending on, know, anonymity provided
comfortable interviewer forth. - infidelity, mean
intercourse somebody else? not talking quote unquote, emotional
affairs. talking just sex somebody committed partner
unbeknownst partner. - Right, right. forms infidelity,
get into, including emotional infidelity financial infidelity. here,
just talking about, moment, sexual infidelity. interesting thing
sexual infidelity sexes really differ fundamentally motives committing
infidelity. men, primary motive, average sex differences.
whenever talk sex differences, talking average sex differences,
cause overlap distributions. generalizations
exceptions. men, mainly matter sexual variety. 70% men,
opportunity presented itself, town opportunity. low
risk, low cost pursuit sexual variety, sexual novelty, key motivation men. -
Sorry interrupt. 70% men cheat primary cause, 70%


men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank
you. Well, delight talk hope engage research

men cheat? - No, no, no. men cheat, 70%, thank clarification,
men cheat 70% cite key motive, key reason
committed infidelity. - Sort like mountain climbers climb mountains,
there? - Right, right. there, comedian, think Chris
Rock said, men faithful opportunity. - available
password phone partner. - Right, right. So, but,
exaggeration, look women, just desire pure novelty, sexual variety,
much less motive, women affairs cite unhappy
primary relationship, emotionally unhappy, sexually unhappy, typically both.
may seem like totally obvious that, well, course, people unhappy
relationship likely stray, fact, not true men. compare
men happy marriage, men not happy marriage,
no difference infidelity rates. think goes issue of,
know, motive seeking variety. now women it? risky
endeavor. risks long-term mate losing long-term mate. risky terms
reputational damage sexes. risky thing. women it?
two competing hypotheses, least two, two primary competing
hypotheses evolutionary literature. One called dual mating strategy
hypothesis, women seeking get resources investment one guy
good genes another guy. principle can work. initially
wasn't hypothesis original me. is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,
others, Marty Hazelton, former student mine, advocated dual mating
strategy hypothesis. originally endorsed it, data seemed
support it, can get data seemed support it. time became
dubious hypothesis, instead advocated call
mate switching hypothesis. look whole host information around
women affairs, not compatible dual mating strategy hypothesis.
So, compatible mate switching, is, women looking either
divest existing mateship, trade mating market mate
compatible higher mate value, simply see whether
sufficiently desirable, eases transition mating pool, keeping
mate made potential backup mate, call mate insurance. car
insurance something bad happens car, house insurance, also mate
insurance, know. One women said, men like soup, always want one


back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth

back burner. So, whether best analogy not, not sure, kind
captures something, so, well, evidence talking about? Well, one
thing, women affairs, 70% them. - Again, sorry, just, want
make sure. women affairs. - say, ballpark, Kinsey was, say
roughly right, 25-26% women will affairs. just assume right.
don't know exactly, women affairs, 70% say
fallen love affair partner. become deeply emotionally involved
affair partner. me, just trying get good genes guy,
last thing want fall love get emotionally involved,
compatible want switch mates. sort of, one piece
evidence suggests women, mate switching function infidelity
likely explanation. Now, two not inherently incompatible hypotheses.
words, possible women

00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference

pursue dual mating strategy hypothesis, evidence suggests,
example, actual rates genetic cuckoldry? Well modern
environment anyway, pretty low. turns like 2-3%. - just
explain audience genetic cuckoldry is? - woman,
man believes genetic father child, turns not, might
mailman next door neighbor guy affair with. mistaken
paternity genetic cuckoldry just one way capture it. - Named cuckoo
bird, right? - Named cuckoo bird, yeah. - sneaks eggs nest
other, destroys future offspring bird, basically offloads
work onto another. - Right. - Father. - Parasitizes, yeah parental investment
different bird species. anyway, think that, sources evidence
think points, one sources evidence initially seemed support
dual mating strategy hypothesis ovulation shifts. words, looked like
early studies women ovulating, among non-pill-taking
women, women not hormonal contraceptives, experienced preference
shift toward men masculine symmetrical, hypothesized
markers good genes. explanation that, turns effects
ovulation women's mate preferences far weaker initial studies looked


like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men

like. fact, larger scale studies failed replicate entirely.
one key sources evidence. ovulation shifts women
going genes, ovulating, can get pregnant
sex another man make sense sex
another man. even early evidence women timing
affairs, timing sex affair partners coincide ovulating.
But, said, subsequent studies failed replicate early
findings, calling question dual mating strategy notion.

00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment

shifted views this, now endorse mate switching hypothesis
likely explanation women affairs. - way describe
makes wonder if, women affairs, affairs tend
long lasting affairs men have, way describe it, men
seizing opportunity sort carpe diem type approach infidelity, women
potentially average, capitalizing something longer term. Now, course,
around ovulation, constrain amount times
need see sex person not married to.
evidence women ongoing affairs men transient
affairs? - Yeah, is. look people affairs, sex
difference there. women tend affairs one person, become
emotionally involved one person time. Men affairs tend
affairs larger number affair partners. so, definition, can't
long lasting. can't long-term affairs six different partners. - Unless
juggling multiple phone accounts something. - Right, right. men try
that, think taxing. - Yeah, day age, easier meet
people virtue online communications, also easier get caught,
meaning harder conceal interactions. Everything's cloud anyway. good
friend mine former high level special operations, said anything not
head head available others find, want it,
think largely true. - Yeah so, phone information, text messages, people
good hacking partners' phones, computers. also
video cameras everywhere. sneaking off quiet restaurant, mean,


probably eight video cameras can record walking restaurant.

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank

00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity

- Everything can found. certain that. mentioned emotional affairs
financial infidelity, well. girlfriend who, early date discussion said,
not get impression are, want clear. said,
not emotionally, physically financially tied women. thought
interesting now bring financial infidelity. quite happily
partnered now not me, but, interesting, first time heard anyone
spell way list, almost like specific aims grant. emotional
infidelity? financial infidelity? - Yeah, yeah. Well, smart woman,
tapped three. So, assumed gave honest responses three
questions. - recall did, now know, can ask point. - Right,
right. - self deception service deception another issue.
emotional infidelity basically exactly sounds like. falling love
someone else, becoming psychologically close someone else, sharing intimate
private information someone else. mean emotional infidelity.
one hallmarks study done former student mine, Barry Cooley,
clever thought. analyzed, used reality TV show called
Cheaters, hire detectives, would, detective
like, say follow someone hotel room, call partner say,
husband just walked hotel room someone else. like come
hotel confront him? certain percentage people confront,
analyzed, analyzed episodes show called Cheaters.
examined verbal interrogations people confronted
partners. men confronted partners, first question want know
is, fuck him? Women, first question was, love her? kind
captures difference sexual infidelity emotional infidelity, also
kind captures another sex difference comes sexual jealousy, know,
men tend focused sexual components infidelity,
compromise paternity certainty, certainty actually
genetic father whatever offspring ensue, whereas love cue to, love her?
cue going leave you, woman, another woman, cue that,


long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank

long-term loss investment commitment partner.
sexes seem differ aspects infidelity, women attuned
upset emotional infidelity, men, sexual infidelity. Now, financial
infidelity explored much less, new book, Men Behave Badly,
section financial infidelity, summarize research
done. kind flabbergasted percentage people things like
credit cards spouse doesn't know about, keep secret bank accounts,
credit card bills mailed office rather home, basically
resources expenditures pooled resources keep partner,
sexes it. percentages vary study study, range like
30 60% people keeping financial information spouse one
way another. woman's buying designer purses, designer
handbags. guys going strip clubs taking affair partner
restaurants, doesn't want charges show on, know, jointly held
credit card. financial infidelity critical. even things like diverting pooled
resources one set genetic relatives versus another set another thing people
tend keep secret. forms financial infidelity, well. So, yeah, infidelity,
absolutely, great question, shouldn't confined sexual
infidelity, people think about, also emotional financial.
Interestingly, ask people, infidelity marriage? Men tend say, well,
obvious sex someone else, infidelity. Whereas women
likely broader definition infidelity. will cite things like emotional
infidelity,

01:04:35 Contraception

financial infidelity, part definition. Whereas men narrow
definition. - Interesting. good friend couples counselor, clinical
psychologist, told something interesting relates this,
cases infidelity, oftentimes arguments couples boil
whether not contraception used not. becomes key feature,
always thought was, know, homing detail, course
important detail relates paternity issues pregnancy, also disease,
right. talking this, makes think may deeper


evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring

can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth

evolutionary roots our, brain, say neuroscience literature.
- yeah, using condom versus not using condom, not using intimate act
way, literally physically intimate someone else,
use condom. whether evolutionary roots this, don't know, mean condoms
probably relatively recent, least widespread use relatively recent
evolutionary time. doubt adaptation specifically them. - No,
presumably condoms, one can speculate say,
comes behavior, rarely fossil record, sometimes is,
withdrawal method contraception, good friend mine studies, whose
laboratory works reproductive biology, says reason poor choice
contraception

01:06:22 Status & Mating Success

designed not work. note trying avoid unwanted
pregnancy. talked little bit status terms men women
selecting for, different types relationships. anything else status
find particularly interesting, know, men finding attractive besides
these, know, waist hip ratios quality potential mothers forth.
kind hidden gems literature around might not heard
of? - Well, yeah. mean among, things like sex differences leads high
status? - instance, what, perhaps things surprising terms
people selecting for. people even know selecting for?
subconscious? topics interest me. - take
reverse order. know, think lot conscious, certainly
unconscious, elements totally unconscious. mentioned one
earlier man looks woman, not, aware attracted
attracted physical appearance, might not aware why. didn't
evolve aware why, just like food preferences, find certain things
delectable things nauseating, don't understand adaptive logic
food preferences exist them. true mating,
know? men find women low waist-hip ratio attractive, might not,
almost rarely, rarely will know, oh, low waist ratio actually associated
higher fertility, lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera. So,


sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind
unattractive guy, older unattractive guy, stunningly beautiful woman
girlfriend. say, well, guy about? say, oh, must
high status. must wealthy. must lot going him, whereas
reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men

sometimes aware want, unaware want it. So,
unconscious elements whole topic status leads high status low
status, topic currently investigating, published couple scientific articles it.
maybe hold off future discussion, intersects, mention
one, intersects mating interesting ways, higher status gives people
ability choose wider pool potential mates low
status. one reasons people strive status
access desirable mates. Conversely, desirable mates endows
higher status. have, male, attractive woman
arm leads high status. reciprocal link status
mating way. there've studies where, say pose kind

reverse people don't make attributions. interesting
reciprocal link status mating success,

01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence

mating success leads high status, high status leads mating
success. - again, instances describe
assessment potential mates, sexual long-term partnership, made
contents good statistical practices, looking choices others readout
choices. seems theme not made narrow
context, paying attention people paying attention to. seems
come again. Slightly off center that, still paying attention
people paying attention to. known jealousy men versus
women? frequent is, intense is, people jealousy.
mean, hear, heard point large fraction homicides
consequence jealous lovers. darkest angle this, evolutionary
psychology context, jealousy? relate paternity issues only? can
tell us jealousy? Yeah, great set questions, first started
studying jealousy, reviewed prior publications jealousy. time,
jealousy regarded sign immaturity, sign insecurity, sign neurosis


pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men

pathology, cases delusion. argued is, argue,
jealousy evolved emotion serves several adaptive functions, okay? One
mentioned paternity certainty function. back second, basically,
evolution long-term mating, long-term pair bonds, talking
male perspective, investing tremendous amount resources woman
children years decades, even boomerang kids now, may go
two decades. - Boomerang kids? - Kids leave home come back
live home. - happens? - Oh yeah, happens. - don't children. - Okay
yeah, no big thing. - just expect come back. -
come back can't find job, find cheaper live parent's
house, whatever. - Oh, goodness. can't think anything worse. mean, love
parents. - know, can't imagine, happens happening more,
given current economic situation. But, long-term mating, need
defense prevent preserve investment made making
long-term mateship. jealousy serves mate guarding function, will,
mate retention function. words, one way phrasing this, know
affairs, know people break up, get divorced, people
adaptations want hold mates, okay? jealousy's part
about. jealousy gets activated threats romantic
relationship. forms jealousy, like sibling jealousy forth,
focusing mating jealousy context. now interesting
threats ongoing, valued romantic relationship come many sources.
be, detect cues partner's infidelity, cues lack emotional
distance partner. say, love partner,
partner says, wonder hell Knicks scoring season,
whatever. get unreciprocated love bad cue. - half,
people tuned this, half millisecond delay, can detect delays
responses. - Yes, yeah. Delays responses, even things like, one set
cues, another set interested mate poachers. So, know,
mated someone desirable, many people are, people still desire
them, sometimes try poach them, lure away short term
sexual encounter, longer term relationship. be, jealousy
motivates people attentive potential mate poachers environment,
even subtle things like mate value discrepancies can trigger jealousy. even


no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank
you. Well, delight talk hope engage research

no mate poachers no accused infidelity, mate value discrepancy opens
relationship. American system, like six eight ten,
people generally pair off based similarity mate value. - tends happen,
sixes end sixes, sevens end sixes, plus minus one.
somewhat subjective scales. - Somewhat subjective, still consensus
things. even colloquially people, colloquially people say things like,
not good enough you, know, think better people
implicitly notion relative mate value discrepancies therein,
discrepancies can open none previously existed. get fired job.
sudden, know, people understanding forgiving
that, not long, go six months, eight months, people start
problems, someone's career takes off. say woman becomes famous singer
actress, man does, career takes off. sudden mate value
discrepancy access larger pool potential mates higher mate
value potential mates. So, people attentive mate value discrepancies.
jealousy can get activated, even no immediate threats relationship,
mate value discrepancy threat looms horizon relationship,
know statistically higher mate value person likely
affair likely dump person trade mating market. -
people find new partners long-term relationships, tend trade up?
- average yes, discrepancy sufficiently large, costs associated
breaking up, divorcing example, mean, emotionally, financially, costly
thing. like half point mate value discrepancy, not going
see lot breakups, know, larger mate value discrepancies,
going augur trading mating market. So, get into,
jealousy is, emotion gets activated circumstances.
people depends options are. people things I,
published scientific work, say range vigilance violence. whole spectrum
things. fact, identified 19 different tactics people use deal problems
get jealous, one increased vigilance, extreme violence. -
Vigilance behavior mate. - Yeah, vigilance behavior mate.
can include stalking, following, hacking iPhones computers, monitoring
behavior mate poachers, looking eye contact men
partner. whole suite things know, involved vigilance.


extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth

extreme, can talk things between, extreme
violence. new book, Men Behave Badly, whole chapter
intimate partner violence. argue, really unfortunate,
not endorsing it. illegal, bad, don't it. people will engage intimate partner
violence America, something like 28 30% people married will
experience intimate partner violence relationships, not trivial percentage.
- violence two partners. - two partners, yes.
also violence gets directed potential mate poachers, somewhat
separate issue. one things functional violence tends
reduce perceived mate value discrepancies. words, guys tend engage
violence women do, although argue equality
violence, minimum men tend damage violence.
- talking violence, ever emotional violence? - Yeah,
well. fact, two tend correlated. studies
married couples, verbal violence good predictor physical violence happening
well. one things that'll happen, just give concrete example, guys will start
insulting partner's appearance. really looking ugly today. thighs
heavy or, know, not looking good, try denigrate woman's
appearance, key component woman's mate value. - trying
adjust closely mate value discrepancy. - Yeah, trying reduce
perceived, self-perceived mate value. if, say six, eight,
can convince actually six, going likely stay
him. - diabolical. - terribly diabolical. fact women don't feel good
get beaten partner. fact, cases
leaves physical evidence, women wear sunglasses turtlenecks cover up,
bruises literally lower mate value woman injuring physical
appearance. - getting conceal herself, stay home, et cetera. Yeah, taking
the, literally reducing visibility. - Right, actually one
predictors violence, starts things violence, like cutting off
relationships friends family, trying sequester her, prevent
getting exposed potential partners. diabolical, think
important understand, know, potential functionality intimate partner
violence. - about, sorry interrupt again, just curious. oftentimes
audience will say interrupt often, want make sure don't miss


opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth

opportunity ask intimate partner violence direction, female
male, stereotypically speaking opportunity physical violence still
there, idea mind psychological nature. Although
think evidence women beat husbands, guessing not
frequent off? - Well, different studies, depends whether just
simply count acts, whether look damage done. And,
mentioned, men tend physical damage, shelters battered
women country. far know, one battered men. Now may
be, partly true men ashamed get beaten
partner, clocked frying pan, possible, evidence police
don't take seriously. one case report book guy called
police, wife clocked something, police shows
says, much broke fingernail altercation, charge not
her. police bias, potential police bias this. may
under-reporting women beating men consequence. But, motivations
often different. one male sexual jealousy will trigger attack partner,
will use physical violence defend herself. might pick frying
pan, weapon sort defend herself. motivation sexual
jealousy part, self-defense part. accounts
unknown percentage cases, cases, women outraged
discover partner's sex someone else, infidelity
sexual, financial, emotional nature. female male violence
absolutely occurs. reduction perceived mate value discrepancy key
function male perspective.

01:24:13 Specificity Intimate Partner Violence

Again, not thinks this, just angry wants hurt her, okay? Okay,
one thing really interesting intimate partner violence,
specificity depending circumstances, namely,
woman gets pregnant, vulnerable physical violence, man
suspects not father pregnancy, likely direct violence
toward blows abdomen. specific. case function
hypothesized function, terminate pregnancy rival male, opposed


deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,

quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back

goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth

deterring woman committing infidelity, leaving relationship
entirely. one function intimate partner violence, just sequestering
woman

01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.

keeping himself. prevent infidelity prevent defection. -
friend whose wife told cheats kill him, said,
actually just much easier keep very, busy. statement now leaps
mind, describing, many tactics people
can engage effort reduce mate value discrepancy, not overtly
violent, designed constrain behavior. - Right, right. Yeah,
fall call mate retention tactics, one two
fall violence category. Yeah, even, yeah, within partner
psychological manipulations things. psychological
manipulations perceived mate value, no one else want you, loser
denigration partner within relationship, even feigning anger make
partner feel guilty say, looking someone else. kinds inter
nesting warfare goes within relationships manipulate perceptions
things. is, creating much jaded view romance love, think. - Oh no,
will get happy endings. mean, certainly many happy relationships
there. neuroscientist, hear this, immediacy people fall
pattern jealousy, pattern cheating and, not always, just speaks
brain circuitry evolved protect something. sure statement not
exhaustive, think accurate say every species, especially humans,
wants make protect young, issues paternity
resource allocation, think vital. Yeah, look forward day evolutionary
psychology neuroscience can merge level underlying mechanism.

01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy

don't think dark, think just way wired level. Speaking
dark, tell us dark triad? - Yeah, dark triad,
talking sex differences average, critical within-sex individual


differences, dark triad one important ones. dark triad consists
three personality characteristics, narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy.
Hallmarks narcissism things like grandiosity, person thinks
intelligent, attractive, dazzling, charming actually are.
think greatest person since sliced bread. Importantly, narcissism,
also get sense entitlement. feel entitled larger share pie, whether
financial pie, status pie, sexual pie. Machiavellianism high
scorers tend pursue exploitative social strategy. might feign cooperation,
cheat, know, subsequent moves. view people pawns
manipulated instrumental gains. psychopathy, one
hallmarks psychopathy lack empathy. people normal empathy
circuit child falls gets hurt, feel compassion harm
person undergoing. puppy gets hit car whatever, feel
compassion, psychopaths don't. high this, dimensional thing,
not categorical thing. high psychopathy basically lack empathy.
combine qualities, narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
well, bad dudes. say bad dudes 'cause men tend score higher
things women, especially psychopathy dimension. talk
clinical levels psychopathy, estimated something like 1% women
4% men. men much higher that. important? Well,
important mating context, high dark triad traits tend
sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time

oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms

sexual deceivers one. often charming, good
seducing women, abandoning sometimes with, fleecing
draining bank account. good art seduction, also tend
sexual harassers, serial sexual harassers, sexual coercers. comes
forms sexual violence, high dark triad guys tend perpetrators this. like
men think, be, find ethically abhorrent sexually harass woman
workplace, dark triad guys, part maybe feel entitled it, part do.
mean, cases report book, like literal descriptions
guys writing journals, knew attracted me. know,
met Xerox room just there, 'cause wanted admire
bulging biceps whatever. - them. - Yeah, they, gets
bias talk about, male sexual misperception bias, woman
smiles man, man thinks, oh, wants body, attracted me. women


thinking, oh, just friendly, polite professional. guys
high dark triad guys susceptible sexual over-perception bias,
literally believe woman attracted sending signals, green
lights sexually approach. combine dark triad traits dispositional
pursuit short-term mating strategy, especially deadly combination.
get sexual harassment, sexual coercion. bad dudes, also
predictors intimate partner violence. - approximate frequency male
population three dark triad traits. realize continuum,
sociopathy, narcissism. - can't say continuum,
sort arbitrary draw line. think minority men.
subset men commit vast majority acts sexual violence.
not like, look victims sexual violence, numerous
perpetrators sexual violence, perpetrators tend serial offenders,
speak. One guy workplace, harassing 15 different women, one guy sexually
coercing, know, multiple women. like, well-known cases
news, like Harvey Weinstein, know, probably hundred different women,
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, famous cases, large number
victims, pretty much [indistinct] perpetrators. no question
guys

01:33:25 Stalking

like Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein definitely high dark triad traits. -
mentioned stalking briefly. Maybe just talk less known
features stalking. think heard give lecture said one
scariest things stalking sometimes works. - Yes, yeah. So, well
stalking multiple motivations, one frequent motivations mating
motivation, either breakup woman dumps guy guy
doesn't want get dumped, wants maintain relationship her.
say that, comes criminal stalking, huge sex difference. 80%
stalkers tend men, 20% women. women stalkers,
they're, fourth number compared men. motivation guys
tends either attempt get back together woman, either sexually
relationship or, and/or interfere future mating prospects. works


time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful
experimental design. certain people going want learn
work. Certainly will give links social media sites.
written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin
family, extended family, friendships, social hierarchy, status hierarchies, warfare,
topics. evolutionary psychology textbook broadest book.
maybe second broadest Evolution Desire: Strategies Human Mating.
interested conflict sexes, latest book, Men
Behave Badly. - Fantastic. love work. grateful clarity depth
rigor it, convey us. know speak many people
just want say thank you. tremendously informative conversation. - Thank
you. Well, delight talk hope engage research

acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings

something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

don't know, psychologist. come beautiful

written tremendous number really interesting books. Tell us recent
book, maybe others, people interested topics,
want learn more, explore. - Sure. Okay so, well, recent
book called, Men Behave Badly: Hidden Roots Sexual Deception,
Harassment, Assault, book deals conflict sexes, sexual
conflict. deals call mating market conflicts.
topics talking about, deception internet dating, things like that.
Second conflict occurs within mating relationships, sort
talking well, financial infidelity, emotional infidelity, sexual infidelity, coping
conflict within relationship. actually suggestions strategies
coping conflict within relationship. Coping dealing aftermath
breakups. often asymmetry. One person wants break up,
doesn't. talk coping aftermath. also talk book,
Men Behave Badly, darker sides human mating, like intimate
partner violence, stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.


book's about. think it, gotten well-reviewed people find useful
understanding otherwise lot baffling phenomena. men women
seem odds many domains? recurrent
forms sexual conflict occur? book's about. previous book,
first book, good fortune able revise couple times,
deals broadly human mating strategies. called, Evolution Desire:
Strategies Human Mating. gives people broad overview people want
mate, tactics attraction, tactics mate retention, forth, throughout
whole mating process, serial mating, causes divorce, forth. even
broadly, textbook called, Evolutionary Psychology: New Science
Mind, sixth edition right now, widely used textbook
evolutionary psychology around North America Europe. actually
translated even Arabic countries. deals somewhat mating,
also deals survival problems, evolved fears phobias, issues kin

time two senses. One interfere attempts remate. fact,
scares off guys. like show pick woman apartment
date ex sitting glaring you. - Or, actually familiar
circumstance early relationship, somebody mentions ex made
veiled threats surveillance, instance. actually happen several
times dating history someone say, started opening
previous relationships little bit, appropriate, someone says, yeah, know,
mentioned going to, know, send someone around to, know,
surveil me, know, kind thing, interesting factoid pick up.
heard enough times, people know reported hearing enough times
guessing probably frequent people actually trailing people
cars things sort. planting that, like psychological seed
surveillance form harassment sense. - Yes, absolutely. think
right, planting psychological seeds, also surveillance,
surveilers remain hidden, don't know necessarily. - Yeah, confess case,
not act deterrent continuing relationship, another story. So,
often women respond? put quotes listening, air
quotes end quotes, positively stalk. mean, often work re-secure
partner broken with. - studies, minority cases
works reestablish. think something like 15% time works, either
temporarily reestablish sexual relationship, lure woman back
permanent relationship. time doesn't work. one woman study
said, guy, every time went another guy, threaten
guy. said six months, no guys. basically scared
off guys. went back no guys
around. - Yeah, experienced college, lived small town,
population dense. Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara. couple every
time woman date someone, basically beat whoever new suitor
was. pretty soon no one go near them. got reputation kind
Sid Nancy couple, indeed worked, worked sense no one dare go
near ended together. seen real life examples this. - Yeah,
happens, general, not successful strategy. - Oh no, not
suggesting. just shocked learn that, 'cause hear stalking this,
one extreme image it. underlying motivations think, reveal


something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous

something mating dynamics. - Yeah, think circumstances often
mate value discrepancy guy realizes correctly will unable replace
mate equivalent mate value, cases mate, know, like,
well once, maybe can get back again. psychology
understandable, tends not work because, thing
found, study 2,500 victims stalking. Josh Duntley, former
student mine, now professor criminology department.
found large sex, large differences stalker victim
stalker, stalker tends much lower mate value victim.
basically typically woman realizes can lot better mating
market, guy realizes never going able replace woman
equivalent mate value.

01:39:15 Influence Children Mate Value Assessments

going use last ditch desperate measure try get back,
occasionally works. - thinking mate value thing, number,
metric, eight, ten, six, whatever is. mate value discrepancy playing
strong role dynamics. asked earlier, impact
mate value perceived real woman already children? know,
instance, there, friends mine married divorced children, will
often post pictures children online profiles,
shows strong sense paternal instinct. know, puppy thing. People
dogs puppies demonstrating capacity care, caretaking. women,
opposite also true. Women children show capacity, demonstrates fertility,
least one point, perhaps fertility still present. positively, negatively,
neutrally impact woman already children seeking another mate,
regardless whether not married children wedlock? -
general rule, decreases mate value, kids another mate viewed
cost, not benefit. costs multiple dimensions, one
going cost guy, going invest resources, time,
attention, forth, also portion effort resources going devoted
toward kids not genetically related him. one reason step
families, often lot conflict within step families, explicable


evolutionary perspective. general, cost, not benefit. Sometimes can
benefit though. know one case woman got divorced, two kids
ended successfully mating guy also divorced primary
custody two kids. compatibility there, general rule,
will decrease woman's man's mate value kids, especially kids
financially, young financially dependent. But, happens is, say
woman eight without kids, guy six might able attract
might feel lucky attract her, no way would've able attract
conditions. display effort, investing kids,
often mating tactic. showing, okay, willing invest kids. willing
sacrifice. essence become equivalent mate value result that.
will able attract average, eights, less likely, true
guys. reason affects women men
custody tends go women. kids, women tend greater custody,
women tend invest kids throughout lives. Now,
things like alimony child support payments, forth, women
talked to, talked one-on-one many women this. view guy kids
cost, not benefit, unless kids old enough left home, no
longer financially dependent. - everything just described consistent
said earlier, subsequent marriages, men get older,
tendency seek mates progressively younger? - Right. -
higher, lower probability already children, much younger. - Right,
right. guy's successful,

01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity

status resources qualities associated higher mate
value, will remain attractive younger women. - realize not specific
area expertise, days lot discussion early childhood
attachment parents influences mate choice later on, kind general categorization
avoidant anxious anxious avoidant kind thing. again,
putting hat neuroscientist, think, know, makes sense neural
circuits attachment childhood somehow, partially whole, repurposed
forms attachment. don't just tend say, okay, brain circuitry


kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

02:06:56 Books: Men Behave Badly; Evolution Desire, Textbooks

teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully
application consider aspects, ultimately consider also light of,
know, firmly someone believes vision trying bring
profession. a, think, largely subconscious process, aware
can helpful, yeah, somebody confident tend think
going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.
can effective. California, live California, sure
seen fair share cases like that. - Oh yeah, think, across today's discussion
various examples pop mind

02:05:35 Future Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience

seeing features humans. interesting. find work
incredibly interesting. think field evolutionary psychology fascinating. And,
hope, said before, say again. feel like neuroscience evolutionary
psychology nudging towards one another. matter time


merge formal way. mean, work instance, polygamous versus
monogamous [indistinct], levels vasopressin, big leap go
vasopressin [indistinct], no disrespect beautiful work, humans say,
oh, vasopressin inhaler going make monogamous something. think
probably got direction effect wrong, get point. - Yeah, no, think
absolutely right. think will happen. think starting happen. will
happen getting neuroscience getting underlying mechanisms
driving process. So, know, evolutionary perspective brings
bear, evolved function ultimate explanation, selective forces created
adaptations, functions adaptations, neuroscience brings well,
underlying machinery mechanisms instantiated in? - It'd
wonderful collaborate someday. Maybe brain imaging study jealousy
something,

kid now adult, develop new attachment
circuitry. guessing evolves whatnot, anything interesting that,
childhood attachment strategies vis-a-vis stability long-term partner choice,
big leap us make here? - Yeah well, mean, can offer sort
informed speculation it, point, not area expertise, know
little bit it, mean, think that, know, secure attachment style,
partners secure attachment style, conducive longterm mateship.
Avoidant attachment styles, avoidant people tend difficulty intimacy
also higher probability infidelity, anxious attachment style, don't know, can
create problems own, know, overly clingy dependent, know,
absorbing call high relationship load. So, know, like mutation load,
certain number mutations. parasite load. also
call relationship loads. baggage someone brings
relationship? - Probably correlated frequency demand immediate text
message responses. Well, think frequency demand, like latent,
expected low latency text message responses plays consistently relationships,
know, early on, low expectation response. people get
attached, depending level anxiety, don't hear back somebody
really quickly, mind goes interesting aspect, know,
become suspicious? become anxious? Can stabilize internal
milieu, need see dot dot dot, coming back? love see study
point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, good one. intuition
suggests prediction pan out. insecure
really be, know, getting upset were, not immediate
response texts. - friend, female friend deliberately quote unquote
using language, trains potential partners comfortable variable
response latency. asked comfortable variable response
latency, said, absolutely not. asymmetry, least case.

01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships

almost certainly rare circumstance, remiss didn't ask
unconventional relationships. days, don't think just virtue living
California, hear monogamish, opposed monogamous,


various forms polyamory may may not include -amory part. know,
passes permission, based seasoned circumstance prior infidelities, like,
okay, somebody mishap early on, know, one pass, speak,
hear kind language getting thrown around. intriguing
seems like effort bypass more, will, hardwired, least
culturally hardwired aspects mate choice sexual partner choice. know,
acknowledging jealousy, confronting allowing partner somebody
else, instance. confess, friends unconventional relationships.
friends conventional relationships. thoughts polyamory. - Yeah,
couple thoughts it. haven't studied extensively, think
way phrase attempt overcome certain evolved features
mating psychology, often service aspects mating
psychology. mean this. talk polyamory, first all,
sex difference, average, is, men likely want initiate
polyamorous relationship women. lots exceptions. actually know
least one exception, personally, friends mine polyamorous
relationship, motivation men evolved desire sexual variety.
gives access wider variety sex partners, part evolved sexual
psychology, especially men. Women, one motivation, women also desire
sexual variety, average tends not great men, also it.
women agree polyamorous relationship mate retention tactic. is,
guy order keep him, agree relationship. so, motivations
engaging polyamory somewhat sex differentiated. - [Andrew] average. -
average, average, lots exceptions. now comes sexual
jealousy, recognition there, way frame it,
evolved emotion triggers sexual jealousy, seeing partner sex,
imagining partner sex, falling love someone else. And,
interestingly, haven't studies this, know one polyamorous
couple reported me, reported me. said doesn't,
doesn't bother husband, married, sex women.
allow it. think like every Thursday night whatever, different couples
different rules. one time saw walking street, hand hand
affectionately former girlfriend got extremely jealous.
signaled emotional connection. sexual didn't bother her, emotional did.


happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.

cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
quite well mating life. - Another point cognitive behavioral desensitization. -
[David] Exactly.

02:02:12 Self Deception

- ran experiment. Just couple questions. Earlier, mentioned self-
deception-based deception, something sort. Self-deception people aren't
always trying convince somebody else something secretly know isn't true,
deceive themselves. embellish little bit? - Well,
actually, hypothesis famous evolutionary biologist, Robert Trivers, first
advanced hypothesis preface, 1976 Dawkins' book, Selfish Gene.
subsequently written it, scientific article


popular book. idea is, core idea successful deception facilitated
self-deception. really believe X, going
successful salesman convince people X. believe you're, say
10 mate value, truly believe it, even not, going
successful time convincing well. hypothesis basically
people self-deceive order increase effectiveness actual deception. think
people one dimension mention too,
animals often take word things. self-confident,
people assume must goods back self-confidence.
quivering mass insecurity, people believe, well, don't goods back
anything. people use people's displays self-confidence cue
goods. general, pretty reliable cue,
overestimates underestimates, talked about, like narcissism. - Yeah,
see job candidates. taught look carefully

going get say going go acts bit heuristic, not
needing, impulses, one doesn't need go vet information quite
carefully. if, guess one aware it, then, know, dig deeper,
seems like lot deception going on. - Yeah well, something talked
earlier, people high psychopathy good deception. don't know
whether good self-deception, whether just really good deceivers.

happened bisexual. partner said really upset
slept men, fine slept women. - think fairly
common thing among men know polyamorous relationships,
fairly common statement. - Yeah, kept trying inter-nesting
manipulations, trying encourage sleep women, not men.
case, encouraging not get emotionally involved women,
sex okay. think that, know, think modern environment,
rich complicated evolved mating psychology.
novel forms semi-novel, things pretty deep history themselves,
attempting maximize evolved desires keeping quiescent
evolved aspects sexual psychology, like jealousy. satisfying desire
sexual variety, keeping jealousy bay, different couples different ways,
alluded to. know one couple live Los Angeles woman,
woman said, gives husband permission affair, sleep
women, long outside city limits LA. couple,
Thursday night, know, different people different plans. - Putting
constraints on, constraints specific somewhat arbitrary
relationship. - Yeah, specific. often polyamorous relationships, people talk
out, come agreement acceptable bounds.
way, mean, it, way just, know, can't change evolved sexual
psychology, don't think. can can activate certain elements it,
keep others quiescent good. way modern
environment. even take outside polyamory, pornography, okay, widely
consumed internet pornography, do? Well, big sex difference
there. Men tend consume lot women. forms pornography
different, way, pornography, parasitized men's evolved
desire sexual variety. can, sense, psychologically experience
sexual, variety different women sexually without actually it, just looking
computer screen. so, way, another way phrasing that, create
modern novel cultural inventions ways satisfy evolved desires
evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, interesting kind explosion online
pornography. colleague Stanford psychiatry, Anna Lembke, studies
dopamine system, mentioned two things interest. One not
tremendous variety experiences available people view


pornography, intensity also quite high, much least young
people observing lot pornography, possible, studies
looking now, brain circuits become wired observing sexual acts,
opposed engaged them,

01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety Truth

can extremely problematic. sharp blade, speak pornography
thing. isn't was, evolving quickly. interesting.
one frame this? imagine number people listening relationships,
hope relationship. terms understanding selecting for,
consciously subconsciously, seems like common themes. people want
feel attractive attracted. People want make sure stability
relationship. hear security, oftentimes think kind warm,
oxytocin, serotonin like thing, mate value, seems powerful this,
assessing mate value. objective people assessing value
terms finding, securing, time, maintaining relationship. Securing
dynamic, people age different rates. objective metric stuff?
guess get lot statistics somebody's image, come
average value based population, people assess themselves?
seems like one features powerful leading
happiness, good partner selection, stable, one doesn't resort
Machiavellian, diabolical, strategies,
honest oneself. one that? - Yeah, great questions. And,
don't think science answers, couple things. one think
people generally pretty good self-assessing mate value. even self-esteem
hypothesized one internal monitoring device tracks mate value.
get promotion work, get rise status, feel elevated sense
self-esteem. get fired, get rejected, get ostracized, self-esteem
plummets. So, self-evaluation, think track mate value extent.
people overestimate mate value, people high narcissism particular,
people underestimate mate value. Another important element
consensual mate value. asked group hundred people,
fair amount consensus person's eight, person's six.


also individual differences mate value. one example know woman
professor places high premium guys deeply steeped
Russian literature, is, can in-depth conversations
Russian literature. - Note young men, learn Russian literature. - Well, high,
dimension mate value important her, probably not important
lot people. so, whereas people say might be, say
football sport, partner thinks sports stupid, know,
that's, know, someone also sports going higher mate value
you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower

you. individual differences components mate value,
good, means everyone going people,
total consensus mate value, lot mateless people, lot
problems world, lot dissatisfied people. So, important,
consensual aspects individually differentiated components mate value.
terms accuracy assessment, no good measures scientifically this,
sufficiently complicated. mentioned, know, mentioned maybe
half, maybe dozen different components mate value, physical attractiveness,
kindness, emotional stability, health status, et cetera. aren't ones.
teach course psychology human mating. ask people, large
course, couple hundred people, tell me, women want mate?
start blackboard. back old days blackboard,
piece chalk, say, want mate good sense humor. write
sense humor. Intelligent, kind. go this, go five
blackboards, run space, women want. Now
men, men kind run space blackboard half.
tells qualities large number complicated nature. say
want guy nice generous? say, yeah. like guy
end every month takes whole paycheck gives wino, homeless
person. Well no, not generous, generous toward me, not toward everyone else.
Nice general, not nice getting exploited. So, even, now
something, can't healthy. put it, uni-dimensional, want
guy, women want guy confident, not confident, confident
will mean either arrogant, narcissistic, not sufficiently manipulable. anyway,
point many different components mate value,
vary amount. not just listing qualities summing up. vary


amount. complicated endeavor assess accurately, think people
good intuitive sense people's relative mate value, especially group
able interact long time. one indication is, again,
attention structure. many people will really want mate person?
good cue high mate value. Nobody wants mate you,
cue low mate value. - Reminds time one trying decide
ask prom. complicated assessment based one like
go with, whether not already partnered, say yes, say no,
risk rejection too, guessing correctly, lower
one's perceived mate value. - Getting rejected. - Right. Frequency rejections
probably doesn't lend well increasing one's view mate value. - Right,
many guys call mating anxiety. is, don't approach
women risk getting shot down. - trying maintain number,
reducing amount data. - [David] Right. - interesting. - backfires
modern environment. So, famous psychologist, Albert Ellis, mating
anxiety assigned task asking, like, can't remember
number was, say 50 women dates. lived New York City,
lot women. - just stand still stream past him. -
asked 50 women date, know, every week. said, two weeks
mating anxiety disappeared, said, buzz off creep, [indistinct]
Actually getting rejected didn't cause world collapse. actually okay.
kind inured rejection. ended up, ended
