thank coming today. looking forward sitting
talk long time. first exposed work post podcast
believe group people walking handrails, literally handrails along
stairwells. a, don't want say former skateboarder, skateboarder,
always skateboarder. skateboarder, handrails particular meaning,


really struck by, first all, incredible range skill people yet
willingness this. Right, think handrails walking handrails
skateboarding handrails potential hazard, yet incredible
proficiency people including had. So, like many people,
drawn practice work initially wide-eyed, "Wow."
know, incredible stuff natural objects, much skateboarders
parkour folks do. years, communication come
realize true intellectual topic movement. define intellectual
somebody can understand topic multiple levels granularity, detail,
general, specific, connections, et cetera. So, start off, share us
conception idea movement? know, obviously movement involves
translation space, talk movement practice,
really thinking about? talking talk movement
practice? - big question. somehow left definition, tight definition
felt starting constrict around let
practice really define it. think part sense everything actually
sense movement stillness background that. So, me,
entity refer movement, using perspective self-evolution
development, course, physical side, also movement emotions, movement
thoughts, movement streams. switching layers
examining different places, get better better sense it. think
visuals nowadays media defines people beginning things.
little little experience, can dive deeper, good.
aspect, sexy aspect not sexy aspect, pull start
examine

00:10:56 Movement & Body-Mind Connection

dive deeper, receive gift it, finding more. - heard say
not just brain body, body brain,
absolutely love student researcher nervous system, never
think brain isolated thing, think nervous system
fact brain spinal cord connected body, body
connected this, brain. every direction, everything truly connected


physical level, physiological level. just share moment think
body-brain relationship terms mentioned movement emotions,
movement body, can't really separate two. typical person
listening this, might not immediately understand means. Maybe
something experienced, think body
brain whole thing working one cohesive whole, mean you?
put simply, movement practice focusing on?
focusing movement limbs? imagine true, also
focusing makes feel feelings make move? - Okay,
okay, thoughts, will try not answer questions
interview, will definitely give thoughts can play it. think
definitions and, general, limitation words ends creating kind
corruptive process. know, words corrupt us corrupt understanding. So,
think brain-body, Cartesian state mind thinking brought lot good,
also brought lot problems. movement, me, entity ties everything
together. magic, thoughts anima, coin spins see
sides appear time. beautiful analogy friend mine, Dr.
Rasmus Olme. So, mind body one pairs, call
movement/body/mind system, integrated, motion. also
stillness appears there, course, without can no motion, maybe
good way start think things. no really pure mental
processes, cognitive processes. no pure physical processes, everything
touches everything, wholeness, wholeness motion. Yeah,
movement practice takes beats examined them. pragmatic
thing, scientist, cerebral thinking movement, important.
emotional side coloring, feeling colors textures motion. lot people
involved movement practice never end feeling motions, really focusing
makes feel feels itself. actual movement, action,
so, action, emotion, thought. three streams movement
interlay together kind braided experience whole experience. try
bring aspects practice

00:14:47 Entry Points Movement



way live life. - think people embark movement practice
will first want know movements do, right? Squats, planks, push-ups,
pirouettes, right? Pick movement, movement. sort
just basic entry points believe everybody walk embrace
movement practice first time maybe even every time movement
practice? mean, earlier today great privilege guided long
series movement practices, yet, first practice involve, first anyway,
stillness not movement. So, would, inform us people think
approaching movement practice? first layer good movement
practice? - So, touched word movement, important separate
word Movement capital M. Movements containers movement
content, content cannot carried way without containers. So,
first entry point choose containers, second thing make sure put
specific content containers enjoy them. tell people like
cup water handed cup water. nowadays often
people will start chew cup instead drinking water, making
discard cup. then, maybe later want bone broth soup use
different container, bowl. So, movement practice start can start anywhere,
rhizome, open system, no center, decentralized, can
approached anywhere, magic benefit it. people
find body good entry point, people don't even enter body.
Sometimes can enter perspectives inside body,
example, enter? decided take body approach, spine
can nice decision, will choose just pelvis. one points
valid. then, playfulness can entry point, attribute, open. So,
don't want limit people limit minds way engage
practice, also want encourage self-inquiry. movements practice,
movement practice? - So, help distinguish two little
bit further? think understand difference sort noun versus
verbs. ways dealing challenge barriers
language present something physical, right? mean, indeed, may not
a... assume no perfect verbal language movement.
certain movements defy language. say somebody jumped particular
trajectory



00:18:08 Early Education Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination

particular speed moved limb limb, fractionating something
definitely lost. So, someone wanted to, say, get better touch
body, quotes, order explore infinite space movement, might
begin approach that? begin awareness, practice, both? -
begins education. know, probably stable point entry,
awareness something concept concept, validity,
sometimes people look looking entity, open entity.
part reason answering questions not something can even
attempt do. believe power non-complete process, like making table,
living something undone, not perfecting product, why? offers
kind dynamic nature evolution naturally unravels it. Almost like
sometimes it, count reps count nine 'cause tends leave people
count keeps going instead giving 10. - Everyone wants end
10. [laughs] - Yeah, decimal system, et cetera. So, kinds
things like also important movement idea discuss, examine,
look, taste, try, also not try capture like invisible
loop Hoffstadt. look closely, gone, look away, functions
exists just like us powerfully obviously gives us experiences
have. So, people enter movement practice, education, bringing
awareness fact living body, living motion,
mind type movement, life type movement. Bringing attention
movement emotions well. Bringing just attention fact things
motion. Heraclitus panta rhei, flux, nothing stops besides something
background allows express, beauty things.
movement practice examination bringing awareness
things. sit now here, also aware body, also aware way
things make feel, way face communicating me. not just
limited verbal, overly verbal state

00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & Environment, Playfulness



misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech
are. low-tech tools, high-tech are.
advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -
Floor, piece floor, piece wall, corner room beautiful scenario,
can become discover play in. And, not developed don't
see options. something try stimulate, made
point avoid big sponsorship high-tech tools. point brought
stick big conventions and/or sometimes use shirt holes just like
used shirt point make addressing crowd keep things
important important, important, experience important.
careful, habits directions, come many times
good intention, devil many times, turn devil, just like
technology nowadays happening people depression,
meaning, meaninglessness, also body various perspectives, even will
also flip high performance sports price. me, not
movement practice, erases person center it. came places like
skateboarding break dancing somebody disability becomes best
world, turns biggest advantage, never accepted
gymnastics class, love that. change

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call
elements, working environment. next one somatic one,
internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small
objects, heavy objects, many objects, objects. can look way
thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always
skips leg day type person, right? know, big upper body, skinny legs,
see people enormous thick torsos bench pressing day,
clearly need pull object every create balance,
don't they, whatever reason, obsession
moving greater greater poundage something like that, certain sports like
power lifting

00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker Movement, Failures & Learning

aesthetics aren't goal, simply push weight off one's chest
imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.
scale. talking scales pain, pleasure, another scale.
discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right
place." becomes high unable resolve, make progress,


went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly
interested in, just gratifying myself, wankery. essence, not searching
discomfort, marker. think question
serving? 'Cause people not serve themselves, essence, serve part, parts it,
kind fraction themselves. separation oneself oneself,
also result practice, good practice. think maybe biggest gift
received practice can say although will take maybe certain context,
not friend. times am, many times not friend. creating
separation, can assume certain stability face everything way
mortality death, is, maybe beyond, knows? - Yeah,
striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution
something, forebrain heightened state focus. hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one
preps extract learning subsequent trials. yet, lot
people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution
feel experience ah negative signal, lean practice,
start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't
correct scale, dynamic moving just like rolling downhill. So,
definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want


achieve, also letting go deambitioning it. within
tension, plus minus comes movement, it.
again, stretch far away, increase one much,
issues, will practice learn recognize optimal point
progression. course, takes many years lot play exposure get
sense it, regardless layer applied. So, sure field
pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us

neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.

Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly

motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves

move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,

can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered

01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate

looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

thank coming today. looking forward sitting
talk long time. first exposed work post podcast
believe group people walking handrails, literally handrails along
stairwells. a, don't want say former skateboarder, skateboarder,
always skateboarder. skateboarder, handrails particular meaning,


really struck by, first all, incredible range skill people yet
willingness this. Right, think handrails walking handrails
skateboarding handrails potential hazard, yet incredible
proficiency people including had. So, like many people,
drawn practice work initially wide-eyed, "Wow."
know, incredible stuff natural objects, much skateboarders
parkour folks do. years, communication come
realize true intellectual topic movement. define intellectual
somebody can understand topic multiple levels granularity, detail,
general, specific, connections, et cetera. So, start off, share us
conception idea movement? know, obviously movement involves
translation space, talk movement practice,
really thinking about? talking talk movement
practice? - big question. somehow left definition, tight definition
felt starting constrict around let
practice really define it. think part sense everything actually
sense movement stillness background that. So, me,
entity refer movement, using perspective self-evolution
development, course, physical side, also movement emotions, movement
thoughts, movement streams. switching layers
examining different places, get better better sense it. think
visuals nowadays media defines people beginning things.
little little experience, can dive deeper, good.
aspect, sexy aspect not sexy aspect, pull start
examine

00:10:56 Movement & Body-Mind Connection

dive deeper, receive gift it, finding more. - heard say
not just brain body, body brain,
absolutely love student researcher nervous system, never
think brain isolated thing, think nervous system
fact brain spinal cord connected body, body
connected this, brain. every direction, everything truly connected


physical level, physiological level. just share moment think
body-brain relationship terms mentioned movement emotions,
movement body, can't really separate two. typical person
listening this, might not immediately understand means. Maybe
something experienced, think body
brain whole thing working one cohesive whole, mean you?
put simply, movement practice focusing on?
focusing movement limbs? imagine true, also
focusing makes feel feelings make move? - Okay,
okay, thoughts, will try not answer questions
interview, will definitely give thoughts can play it. think
definitions and, general, limitation words ends creating kind
corruptive process. know, words corrupt us corrupt understanding. So,
think brain-body, Cartesian state mind thinking brought lot good,
also brought lot problems. movement, me, entity ties everything
together. magic, thoughts anima, coin spins see
sides appear time. beautiful analogy friend mine, Dr.
Rasmus Olme. So, mind body one pairs, call
movement/body/mind system, integrated, motion. also
stillness appears there, course, without can no motion, maybe
good way start think things. no really pure mental
processes, cognitive processes. no pure physical processes, everything
touches everything, wholeness, wholeness motion. Yeah,
movement practice takes beats examined them. pragmatic
thing, scientist, cerebral thinking movement, important.
emotional side coloring, feeling colors textures motion. lot people
involved movement practice never end feeling motions, really focusing
makes feel feels itself. actual movement, action,
so, action, emotion, thought. three streams movement
interlay together kind braided experience whole experience. try
bring aspects practice

00:14:47 Entry Points Movement



way live life. - think people embark movement practice
will first want know movements do, right? Squats, planks, push-ups,
pirouettes, right? Pick movement, movement. sort
just basic entry points believe everybody walk embrace
movement practice first time maybe even every time movement
practice? mean, earlier today great privilege guided long
series movement practices, yet, first practice involve, first anyway,
stillness not movement. So, would, inform us people think
approaching movement practice? first layer good movement
practice? - So, touched word movement, important separate
word Movement capital M. Movements containers movement
content, content cannot carried way without containers. So,
first entry point choose containers, second thing make sure put
specific content containers enjoy them. tell people like
cup water handed cup water. nowadays often
people will start chew cup instead drinking water, making
discard cup. then, maybe later want bone broth soup use
different container, bowl. So, movement practice start can start anywhere,
rhizome, open system, no center, decentralized, can
approached anywhere, magic benefit it. people
find body good entry point, people don't even enter body.
Sometimes can enter perspectives inside body,
example, enter? decided take body approach, spine
can nice decision, will choose just pelvis. one points
valid. then, playfulness can entry point, attribute, open. So,
don't want limit people limit minds way engage
practice, also want encourage self-inquiry. movements practice,
movement practice? - So, help distinguish two little
bit further? think understand difference sort noun versus
verbs. ways dealing challenge barriers
language present something physical, right? mean, indeed, may not
a... assume no perfect verbal language movement.
certain movements defy language. say somebody jumped particular
trajectory



00:18:08 Early Education Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination

particular speed moved limb limb, fractionating something
definitely lost. So, someone wanted to, say, get better touch
body, quotes, order explore infinite space movement, might
begin approach that? begin awareness, practice, both? -
begins education. know, probably stable point entry,
awareness something concept concept, validity,
sometimes people look looking entity, open entity.
part reason answering questions not something can even
attempt do. believe power non-complete process, like making table,
living something undone, not perfecting product, why? offers
kind dynamic nature evolution naturally unravels it. Almost like
sometimes it, count reps count nine 'cause tends leave people
count keeps going instead giving 10. - Everyone wants end
10. [laughs] - Yeah, decimal system, et cetera. So, kinds
things like also important movement idea discuss, examine,
look, taste, try, also not try capture like invisible
loop Hoffstadt. look closely, gone, look away, functions
exists just like us powerfully obviously gives us experiences
have. So, people enter movement practice, education, bringing
awareness fact living body, living motion,
mind type movement, life type movement. Bringing attention
movement emotions well. Bringing just attention fact things
motion. Heraclitus panta rhei, flux, nothing stops besides something
background allows express, beauty things.
movement practice examination bringing awareness
things. sit now here, also aware body, also aware way
things make feel, way face communicating me. not just
limited verbal, overly verbal state

00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & Environment, Playfulness



misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech
are. low-tech tools, high-tech are.
advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -
Floor, piece floor, piece wall, corner room beautiful scenario,
can become discover play in. And, not developed don't
see options. something try stimulate, made
point avoid big sponsorship high-tech tools. point brought
stick big conventions and/or sometimes use shirt holes just like
used shirt point make addressing crowd keep things
important important, important, experience important.
careful, habits directions, come many times
good intention, devil many times, turn devil, just like
technology nowadays happening people depression,
meaning, meaninglessness, also body various perspectives, even will
also flip high performance sports price. me, not
movement practice, erases person center it. came places like
skateboarding break dancing somebody disability becomes best
world, turns biggest advantage, never accepted
gymnastics class, love that. change

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call
elements, working environment. next one somatic one,
internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small
objects, heavy objects, many objects, objects. can look way
thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always
skips leg day type person, right? know, big upper body, skinny legs,
see people enormous thick torsos bench pressing day,
clearly need pull object every create balance,
don't they, whatever reason, obsession
moving greater greater poundage something like that, certain sports like
power lifting

00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker Movement, Failures & Learning

aesthetics aren't goal, simply push weight off one's chest
imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.
scale. talking scales pain, pleasure, another scale.
discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right
place." becomes high unable resolve, make progress,


went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly
interested in, just gratifying myself, wankery. essence, not searching
discomfort, marker. think question
serving? 'Cause people not serve themselves, essence, serve part, parts it,
kind fraction themselves. separation oneself oneself,
also result practice, good practice. think maybe biggest gift
received practice can say although will take maybe certain context,
not friend. times am, many times not friend. creating
separation, can assume certain stability face everything way
mortality death, is, maybe beyond, knows? - Yeah,
striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution
something, forebrain heightened state focus. hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one
preps extract learning subsequent trials. yet, lot
people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution
feel experience ah negative signal, lean practice,
start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't
correct scale, dynamic moving just like rolling downhill. So,
definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want


achieve, also letting go deambitioning it. within
tension, plus minus comes movement, it.
again, stretch far away, increase one much,
issues, will practice learn recognize optimal point
progression. course, takes many years lot play exposure get
sense it, regardless layer applied. So, sure field
pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,

development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

really struck by, first all, incredible range skill people yet
willingness this. Right, think handrails walking handrails
skateboarding handrails potential hazard, yet incredible
proficiency people including had. So, like many people,
drawn practice work initially wide-eyed, "Wow."
know, incredible stuff natural objects, much skateboarders
parkour folks do. years, communication come
realize true intellectual topic movement. define intellectual
somebody can understand topic multiple levels granularity, detail,
general, specific, connections, et cetera. So, start off, share us
conception idea movement? know, obviously movement involves
translation space, talk movement practice,
really thinking about? talking talk movement
practice? - big question. somehow left definition, tight definition
felt starting constrict around let
practice really define it. think part sense everything actually
sense movement stillness background that. So, me,
entity refer movement, using perspective self-evolution
development, course, physical side, also movement emotions, movement
thoughts, movement streams. switching layers
examining different places, get better better sense it. think
visuals nowadays media defines people beginning things.
little little experience, can dive deeper, good.
aspect, sexy aspect not sexy aspect, pull start
examine

00:10:56 Movement & Body-Mind Connection

dive deeper, receive gift it, finding more. - heard say
not just brain body, body brain,
absolutely love student researcher nervous system, never
think brain isolated thing, think nervous system
fact brain spinal cord connected body, body
connected this, brain. every direction, everything truly connected


physical level, physiological level. just share moment think
body-brain relationship terms mentioned movement emotions,
movement body, can't really separate two. typical person
listening this, might not immediately understand means. Maybe
something experienced, think body
brain whole thing working one cohesive whole, mean you?
put simply, movement practice focusing on?
focusing movement limbs? imagine true, also
focusing makes feel feelings make move? - Okay,
okay, thoughts, will try not answer questions
interview, will definitely give thoughts can play it. think
definitions and, general, limitation words ends creating kind
corruptive process. know, words corrupt us corrupt understanding. So,
think brain-body, Cartesian state mind thinking brought lot good,
also brought lot problems. movement, me, entity ties everything
together. magic, thoughts anima, coin spins see
sides appear time. beautiful analogy friend mine, Dr.
Rasmus Olme. So, mind body one pairs, call
movement/body/mind system, integrated, motion. also
stillness appears there, course, without can no motion, maybe
good way start think things. no really pure mental
processes, cognitive processes. no pure physical processes, everything
touches everything, wholeness, wholeness motion. Yeah,
movement practice takes beats examined them. pragmatic
thing, scientist, cerebral thinking movement, important.
emotional side coloring, feeling colors textures motion. lot people
involved movement practice never end feeling motions, really focusing
makes feel feels itself. actual movement, action,
so, action, emotion, thought. three streams movement
interlay together kind braided experience whole experience. try
bring aspects practice

00:14:47 Entry Points Movement



way live life. - think people embark movement practice
will first want know movements do, right? Squats, planks, push-ups,
pirouettes, right? Pick movement, movement. sort
just basic entry points believe everybody walk embrace
movement practice first time maybe even every time movement
practice? mean, earlier today great privilege guided long
series movement practices, yet, first practice involve, first anyway,
stillness not movement. So, would, inform us people think
approaching movement practice? first layer good movement
practice? - So, touched word movement, important separate
word Movement capital M. Movements containers movement
content, content cannot carried way without containers. So,
first entry point choose containers, second thing make sure put
specific content containers enjoy them. tell people like
cup water handed cup water. nowadays often
people will start chew cup instead drinking water, making
discard cup. then, maybe later want bone broth soup use
different container, bowl. So, movement practice start can start anywhere,
rhizome, open system, no center, decentralized, can
approached anywhere, magic benefit it. people
find body good entry point, people don't even enter body.
Sometimes can enter perspectives inside body,
example, enter? decided take body approach, spine
can nice decision, will choose just pelvis. one points
valid. then, playfulness can entry point, attribute, open. So,
don't want limit people limit minds way engage
practice, also want encourage self-inquiry. movements practice,
movement practice? - So, help distinguish two little
bit further? think understand difference sort noun versus
verbs. ways dealing challenge barriers
language present something physical, right? mean, indeed, may not
a... assume no perfect verbal language movement.
certain movements defy language. say somebody jumped particular
trajectory



00:18:08 Early Education Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination

particular speed moved limb limb, fractionating something
definitely lost. So, someone wanted to, say, get better touch
body, quotes, order explore infinite space movement, might
begin approach that? begin awareness, practice, both? -
begins education. know, probably stable point entry,
awareness something concept concept, validity,
sometimes people look looking entity, open entity.
part reason answering questions not something can even
attempt do. believe power non-complete process, like making table,
living something undone, not perfecting product, why? offers
kind dynamic nature evolution naturally unravels it. Almost like
sometimes it, count reps count nine 'cause tends leave people
count keeps going instead giving 10. - Everyone wants end
10. [laughs] - Yeah, decimal system, et cetera. So, kinds
things like also important movement idea discuss, examine,
look, taste, try, also not try capture like invisible
loop Hoffstadt. look closely, gone, look away, functions
exists just like us powerfully obviously gives us experiences
have. So, people enter movement practice, education, bringing
awareness fact living body, living motion,
mind type movement, life type movement. Bringing attention
movement emotions well. Bringing just attention fact things
motion. Heraclitus panta rhei, flux, nothing stops besides something
background allows express, beauty things.
movement practice examination bringing awareness
things. sit now here, also aware body, also aware way
things make feel, way face communicating me. not just
limited verbal, overly verbal state

00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & Environment, Playfulness



misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act

think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark

learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,

going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing

example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement

kind dynamic sleeve can move long not

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

movement/body/mind system, integrated, motion. also
stillness appears there, course, without can no motion, maybe
good way start think things. no really pure mental
processes, cognitive processes. no pure physical processes, everything
touches everything, wholeness, wholeness motion. Yeah,
movement practice takes beats examined them. pragmatic
thing, scientist, cerebral thinking movement, important.
emotional side coloring, feeling colors textures motion. lot people
involved movement practice never end feeling motions, really focusing
makes feel feels itself. actual movement, action,
so, action, emotion, thought. three streams movement
interlay together kind braided experience whole experience. try
bring aspects practice

00:14:47 Entry Points Movement



way live life. - think people embark movement practice
will first want know movements do, right? Squats, planks, push-ups,
pirouettes, right? Pick movement, movement. sort
just basic entry points believe everybody walk embrace
movement practice first time maybe even every time movement
practice? mean, earlier today great privilege guided long
series movement practices, yet, first practice involve, first anyway,
stillness not movement. So, would, inform us people think
approaching movement practice? first layer good movement
practice? - So, touched word movement, important separate
word Movement capital M. Movements containers movement
content, content cannot carried way without containers. So,
first entry point choose containers, second thing make sure put
specific content containers enjoy them. tell people like
cup water handed cup water. nowadays often
people will start chew cup instead drinking water, making
discard cup. then, maybe later want bone broth soup use
different container, bowl. So, movement practice start can start anywhere,
rhizome, open system, no center, decentralized, can
approached anywhere, magic benefit it. people
find body good entry point, people don't even enter body.
Sometimes can enter perspectives inside body,
example, enter? decided take body approach, spine
can nice decision, will choose just pelvis. one points
valid. then, playfulness can entry point, attribute, open. So,
don't want limit people limit minds way engage
practice, also want encourage self-inquiry. movements practice,
movement practice? - So, help distinguish two little
bit further? think understand difference sort noun versus
verbs. ways dealing challenge barriers
language present something physical, right? mean, indeed, may not
a... assume no perfect verbal language movement.
certain movements defy language. say somebody jumped particular
trajectory



00:18:08 Early Education Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination

particular speed moved limb limb, fractionating something
definitely lost. So, someone wanted to, say, get better touch
body, quotes, order explore infinite space movement, might
begin approach that? begin awareness, practice, both? -
begins education. know, probably stable point entry,
awareness something concept concept, validity,
sometimes people look looking entity, open entity.
part reason answering questions not something can even
attempt do. believe power non-complete process, like making table,
living something undone, not perfecting product, why? offers
kind dynamic nature evolution naturally unravels it. Almost like
sometimes it, count reps count nine 'cause tends leave people
count keeps going instead giving 10. - Everyone wants end
10. [laughs] - Yeah, decimal system, et cetera. So, kinds
things like also important movement idea discuss, examine,
look, taste, try, also not try capture like invisible
loop Hoffstadt. look closely, gone, look away, functions
exists just like us powerfully obviously gives us experiences
have. So, people enter movement practice, education, bringing
awareness fact living body, living motion,
mind type movement, life type movement. Bringing attention
movement emotions well. Bringing just attention fact things
motion. Heraclitus panta rhei, flux, nothing stops besides something
background allows express, beauty things.
movement practice examination bringing awareness
things. sit now here, also aware body, also aware way
things make feel, way face communicating me. not just
limited verbal, overly verbal state

00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & Environment, Playfulness



misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech
are. low-tech tools, high-tech are.
advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -
Floor, piece floor, piece wall, corner room beautiful scenario,
can become discover play in. And, not developed don't
see options. something try stimulate, made
point avoid big sponsorship high-tech tools. point brought
stick big conventions and/or sometimes use shirt holes just like
used shirt point make addressing crowd keep things
important important, important, experience important.
careful, habits directions, come many times
good intention, devil many times, turn devil, just like
technology nowadays happening people depression,
meaning, meaninglessness, also body various perspectives, even will
also flip high performance sports price. me, not
movement practice, erases person center it. came places like
skateboarding break dancing somebody disability becomes best
world, turns biggest advantage, never accepted
gymnastics class, love that. change

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call
elements, working environment. next one somatic one,
internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small
objects, heavy objects, many objects, objects. can look way
thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always

see people enormous thick torsos bench pressing day,
clearly need pull object every create balance,

power lifting

00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker Movement, Failures & Learning

aesthetics aren't goal, simply push weight off one's chest
imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring

discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right

went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly

striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans

suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one

people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution

start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't

definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want

pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay

Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word

process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.

movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement

then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best

talking earlier, hack mind something

02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.

love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,

approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like

example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

way live life. - think people embark movement practice
will first want know movements do, right? Squats, planks, push-ups,
pirouettes, right? Pick movement, movement. sort
just basic entry points believe everybody walk embrace
movement practice first time maybe even every time movement
practice? mean, earlier today great privilege guided long
series movement practices, yet, first practice involve, first anyway,
stillness not movement. So, would, inform us people think
approaching movement practice? first layer good movement
practice? - So, touched word movement, important separate
word Movement capital M. Movements containers movement
content, content cannot carried way without containers. So,
first entry point choose containers, second thing make sure put
specific content containers enjoy them. tell people like
cup water handed cup water. nowadays often
people will start chew cup instead drinking water, making
discard cup. then, maybe later want bone broth soup use
different container, bowl. So, movement practice start can start anywhere,
rhizome, open system, no center, decentralized, can
approached anywhere, magic benefit it. people
find body good entry point, people don't even enter body.
Sometimes can enter perspectives inside body,
example, enter? decided take body approach, spine
can nice decision, will choose just pelvis. one points
valid. then, playfulness can entry point, attribute, open. So,
don't want limit people limit minds way engage
practice, also want encourage self-inquiry. movements practice,
movement practice? - So, help distinguish two little
bit further? think understand difference sort noun versus
verbs. ways dealing challenge barriers
language present something physical, right? mean, indeed, may not
a... assume no perfect verbal language movement.
certain movements defy language. say somebody jumped particular
trajectory



00:18:08 Early Education Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination

particular speed moved limb limb, fractionating something
definitely lost. So, someone wanted to, say, get better touch
body, quotes, order explore infinite space movement, might
begin approach that? begin awareness, practice, both? -
begins education. know, probably stable point entry,
awareness something concept concept, validity,
sometimes people look looking entity, open entity.
part reason answering questions not something can even
attempt do. believe power non-complete process, like making table,
living something undone, not perfecting product, why? offers
kind dynamic nature evolution naturally unravels it. Almost like
sometimes it, count reps count nine 'cause tends leave people
count keeps going instead giving 10. - Everyone wants end
10. [laughs] - Yeah, decimal system, et cetera. So, kinds
things like also important movement idea discuss, examine,
look, taste, try, also not try capture like invisible
loop Hoffstadt. look closely, gone, look away, functions
exists just like us powerfully obviously gives us experiences
have. So, people enter movement practice, education, bringing
awareness fact living body, living motion,
mind type movement, life type movement. Bringing attention
movement emotions well. Bringing just attention fact things
motion. Heraclitus panta rhei, flux, nothing stops besides something
background allows express, beauty things.
movement practice examination bringing awareness
things. sit now here, also aware body, also aware way
things make feel, way face communicating me. not just
limited verbal, overly verbal state

00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & Environment, Playfulness



misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech
are. low-tech tools, high-tech are.
advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -
Floor, piece floor, piece wall, corner room beautiful scenario,
can become discover play in. And, not developed don't
see options. something try stimulate, made
point avoid big sponsorship high-tech tools. point brought
stick big conventions and/or sometimes use shirt holes just like
used shirt point make addressing crowd keep things
important important, important, experience important.
careful, habits directions, come many times
good intention, devil many times, turn devil, just like
technology nowadays happening people depression,
meaning, meaninglessness, also body various perspectives, even will
also flip high performance sports price. me, not
movement practice, erases person center it. came places like
skateboarding break dancing somebody disability becomes best
world, turns biggest advantage, never accepted
gymnastics class, love that. change

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call
elements, working environment. next one somatic one,
internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small
objects, heavy objects, many objects, objects. can look way
thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always
skips leg day type person, right? know, big upper body, skinny legs,
see people enormous thick torsos bench pressing day,
clearly need pull object every create balance,
don't they, whatever reason, obsession
moving greater greater poundage something like that, certain sports like
power lifting

00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker Movement, Failures & Learning

aesthetics aren't goal, simply push weight off one's chest
imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.
scale. talking scales pain, pleasure, another scale.
discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right
place." becomes high unable resolve, make progress,


went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly
interested in, just gratifying myself, wankery. essence, not searching
discomfort, marker. think question
serving? 'Cause people not serve themselves, essence, serve part, parts it,
kind fraction themselves. separation oneself oneself,
also result practice, good practice. think maybe biggest gift
received practice can say although will take maybe certain context,
not friend. times am, many times not friend. creating
separation, can assume certain stability face everything way
mortality death, is, maybe beyond, knows? - Yeah,
striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution
something, forebrain heightened state focus. hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one
preps extract learning subsequent trials. yet, lot
people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution
feel experience ah negative signal, lean practice,
start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't
correct scale, dynamic moving just like rolling downhill. So,
definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want


achieve, also letting go deambitioning it. within
tension, plus minus comes movement, it.
again, stretch far away, increase one much,
issues, will practice learn recognize optimal point
progression. course, takes many years lot play exposure get
sense it, regardless layer applied. So, sure field
pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.

right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish

Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons

they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say

motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,

far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer

create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate

US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

00:18:08 Early Education Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination

particular speed moved limb limb, fractionating something
definitely lost. So, someone wanted to, say, get better touch
body, quotes, order explore infinite space movement, might
begin approach that? begin awareness, practice, both? -
begins education. know, probably stable point entry,
awareness something concept concept, validity,
sometimes people look looking entity, open entity.
part reason answering questions not something can even
attempt do. believe power non-complete process, like making table,
living something undone, not perfecting product, why? offers
kind dynamic nature evolution naturally unravels it. Almost like
sometimes it, count reps count nine 'cause tends leave people
count keeps going instead giving 10. - Everyone wants end
10. [laughs] - Yeah, decimal system, et cetera. So, kinds
things like also important movement idea discuss, examine,
look, taste, try, also not try capture like invisible
loop Hoffstadt. look closely, gone, look away, functions
exists just like us powerfully obviously gives us experiences
have. So, people enter movement practice, education, bringing
awareness fact living body, living motion,
mind type movement, life type movement. Bringing attention
movement emotions well. Bringing just attention fact things
motion. Heraclitus panta rhei, flux, nothing stops besides something
background allows express, beauty things.
movement practice examination bringing awareness
things. sit now here, also aware body, also aware way
things make feel, way face communicating me. not just
limited verbal, overly verbal state

00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & Environment, Playfulness



misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech
are. low-tech tools, high-tech are.
advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -
Floor, piece floor, piece wall, corner room beautiful scenario,
can become discover play in. And, not developed don't
see options. something try stimulate, made
point avoid big sponsorship high-tech tools. point brought
stick big conventions and/or sometimes use shirt holes just like
used shirt point make addressing crowd keep things
important important, important, experience important.
careful, habits directions, come many times
good intention, devil many times, turn devil, just like
technology nowadays happening people depression,
meaning, meaninglessness, also body various perspectives, even will
also flip high performance sports price. me, not
movement practice, erases person center it. came places like
skateboarding break dancing somebody disability becomes best
world, turns biggest advantage, never accepted
gymnastics class, love that. change

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call
elements, working environment. next one somatic one,
internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small
objects, heavy objects, many objects, objects. can look way
thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always
skips leg day type person, right? know, big upper body, skinny legs,
see people enormous thick torsos bench pressing day,
clearly need pull object every create balance,
don't they, whatever reason, obsession
moving greater greater poundage something like that, certain sports like
power lifting

00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker Movement, Failures & Learning

aesthetics aren't goal, simply push weight off one's chest
imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.
scale. talking scales pain, pleasure, another scale.
discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right
place." becomes high unable resolve, make progress,


went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly
interested in, just gratifying myself, wankery. essence, not searching
discomfort, marker. think question
serving? 'Cause people not serve themselves, essence, serve part, parts it,
kind fraction themselves. separation oneself oneself,
also result practice, good practice. think maybe biggest gift
received practice can say although will take maybe certain context,
not friend. times am, many times not friend. creating
separation, can assume certain stability face everything way
mortality death, is, maybe beyond, knows? - Yeah,
striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution
something, forebrain heightened state focus. hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one
preps extract learning subsequent trials. yet, lot
people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution
feel experience ah negative signal, lean practice,
start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't
correct scale, dynamic moving just like rolling downhill. So,
definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want


achieve, also letting go deambitioning it. within
tension, plus minus comes movement, it.
again, stretch far away, increase one much,
issues, will practice learn recognize optimal point
progression. course, takes many years lot play exposure get
sense it, regardless layer applied. So, sure field
pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine

talking earlier, hack mind something

something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

misses lot beautiful flux. - going inject project
ideas, perhaps tell ridiculous, potentially useful, useful.
understand talking now discussed earlier
movement can incorporated one's entire life. even heard say
even getting bed morning, one can experience movement,
doesn't necessarily intimate kind somebody else, can
paying attention rhythm one's breath, get bed. actually,
anticipation arriving today, noticed going
stairs house, injecting little bit playfulness way might
many, many decades ago, haven't long time. asked
whether not Ido referring talks threading body
awareness throughout day. opposed to, course not exclusive just
saying 45 minutes, going movement practice shower
dinner. Right, imagine helpful, terms moving
day bodily awareness, clearly infinite number ways one
that, maybe just share few. mentioned, mean, one pay
attention breath, pay attention posture. notion play
attractive say science, sticky concept, concept kind draws one
in. Maybe would, share us just ideas get people thinking
maybe even incorporating movement practice day, maybe even
touch potential role play playfulness? - Okay. Yeah, good
directions. think one thing call wordlessness.
recommending people non-verbal experiences awareness body,
not really awareness body, know, not purely not fully.
awareness motion good way start bring awareness layer.
layer will start get clarified more, practice.
then, will enable people, safe haven away many states difficulties,
will unlock lot potential attributes, strength, freshness, lot
beautiful things. Really one really perspectives comes
person influenced thinking lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, late Moshe
Feldenkrais. talks body core three elements, core nervous
system, two mechanical system muscle, skeleton, et cetera, third
environment, unique way look it. talks nervous
system receiving information outside inside. first


years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech
are. low-tech tools, high-tech are.
advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -
Floor, piece floor, piece wall, corner room beautiful scenario,
can become discover play in. And, not developed don't
see options. something try stimulate, made
point avoid big sponsorship high-tech tools. point brought
stick big conventions and/or sometimes use shirt holes just like
used shirt point make addressing crowd keep things
important important, important, experience important.
careful, habits directions, come many times
good intention, devil many times, turn devil, just like
technology nowadays happening people depression,
meaning, meaninglessness, also body various perspectives, even will
also flip high performance sports price. me, not
movement practice, erases person center it. came places like
skateboarding break dancing somebody disability becomes best
world, turns biggest advantage, never accepted
gymnastics class, love that. change

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call
elements, working environment. next one somatic one,
internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small
objects, heavy objects, many objects, objects. can look way
thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always
skips leg day type person, right? know, big upper body, skinny legs,
see people enormous thick torsos bench pressing day,

00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker Movement, Failures & Learning

aesthetics aren't goal, simply push weight off one's chest
imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.
scale. talking scales pain, pleasure, another scale.
discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right
place." becomes high unable resolve, make progress,


went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly
interested in, just gratifying myself, wankery. essence, not searching
discomfort, marker. think question
serving? 'Cause people not serve themselves, essence, serve part, parts it,
kind fraction themselves. separation oneself oneself,
also result practice, good practice. think maybe biggest gift
received practice can say although will take maybe certain context,
not friend. times am, many times not friend. creating
separation, can assume certain stability face everything way
mortality death, is, maybe beyond, knows? - Yeah,
striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution
something, forebrain heightened state focus. hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one

people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution
feel experience ah negative signal, lean practice,
start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't

definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want

want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

years life, work lot differentiating those, not me?
think movement, feel movement, feel movement outside
is, course, arriving receiving this, also internal movement.
can said stillness. So, bringing attention layers,
tricky thing. one elusive things look at, definitely huge benefit
start train it, start practice it, feel not thoughts, not necessarily body,
start recognize dynamic nature, flux, motion, occurs
layers. So, will need find multiple locations start
make own, make really yours. How, example, simple, pragmatic things
used this, spent time Hong Kong, need get practice in,
really turned off commercial gyms not lot nature accessible
just strap bag walk streets Hong Kong,
crowded try avoid touching anyone. like two
hours just like moving, involved, fully involved, fully body, experiencing
beautiful things, enjoying developing well kinds scenarios,
escalators off. So, example way practice.
then, way sitting like chairs, example, chairs not
dynamic, rocking chairs, right? something recommend lot
kids like schools, used rock chair, common. sure- -
used put skateboard underneath chair roll back forth,
teacher tell stop. just slowly little little trying get
subtle movement without telling going take away, try. -
probably horrible, horrible advice instruction just like sit straight
chew mouth closed remove lot self-education lot
self-development practical discoveries necessary even will
damage focus thinking processes ways. So, example, make
chairs even mobile support motion, able
bring attention there, also able bring attention away
things. keeps refreshing don't become stale, water doesn't stand,
beauty movement. So, can focus long periods time incredible
things mind, focus, awareness, attention. like skin
game, not talking meditator describing act
focused, put stick edge fingers tell him, "Balance it."
everyone can 10 seconds tell him, "Okay, now hold 10 minutes."


see skill has, no skin game. wasn't developed various
scenarios, delusion start develop movement
keeps honest humble way view humility way
protects keeps me, yeah, keeps fresh. - loved example moving
crowded street backpack way completely
adaptive situation happened highlights fact one doesn't
need gym specific scenario, although will certainly touch ideal learning
circumstances movement work doing, course. -
less personal practice, understanding, knowledge done,
toys need. really worked yourself, high-tech

advanced technology far planet. advancement, doesn't even
start scratch, know it, way understand eyes way
respect Boston Robotics, 5-year-old motion- - Yeah, yeah. -
Movements. animal motion underdeveloped, still relatively us systems.
So, important remind ourselves. - lot can done body gravity I- -

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working
another person, dynamic entity communicating you. third one call

internal practice. course, gray zones, another one object
manipulatory, can think also environment, small

thinking, can say, "Oh, many practices direction, not,"
can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always

correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made

00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types Movement, Contents vs. Containers



place change center, important. - touched mention sports,
maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not
sun really. then, talking ways thinking movement,
use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper
crumble them, throw bin, keep life. writing
geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.
physical one, contraction, relaxation. spectrum, pretty much everything
falls spectrum. Also, terms analyzing person yourself, can tell
feel closer side closer side, allows examine
practices. many practices moving towards balance many
addiction just good versus need?
another example, physical culture. So, dense realm working internal
concepts expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. Second perspective,


Marshall concept, not sense just fighting, also partnering, working

can draw yourself. So, another perspective, way use
dozens perspectives. years, gives people sense want
go, want it, need address versus like
address, et cetera. helpful? - helpful, different bins helpful.
really appreciate mentioned people will often practice good
opposed need. gym culture, refer guy always

imagine something beneficial there. However, think really
important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.
scale. talking scales pain, pleasure, another scale.
discomfort necessary recognized as, "I'm right

went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly

discomfort, marker. think question

separation, can assume certain stability face everything way

striking moment earlier today really challenged one

Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute

want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell

saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space

Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best

talking earlier, hack mind something

tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

maybe Charles Poliquin, maybe another trainer heard say
that, "For kids, one worst things can overspecialize particular sport."
idea leads improvements performance narrow domain,
raised idea perhaps also constrains development
nervous system, certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities will
forever shut off intense plasticity occurs early life.
learn you, thinking statement really extended
life. love remind people started off developmental
neurobiologist, development doesn't start end, don't childhood
adulthood. life one long developmental arc birth death, however long
might be. So, one going anti-specialist, maybe even call
generalist, look like? different domains movement
practice? asked this, realized serious danger fractionating
movement list words like strength, speed, explosiveness,
suppleness, word heard use before. yet, think people
think words, often, categories can useful. So, say
going embark movement practice child going embark
movement practice either throughout day dedicated period time,
sorts categories movement might want think about, ballistic
movement, smooth movement? Maybe just enrich us
landscape around that. - Okay, first address first part mentioned.
learned certain changes way things develop later life versus
earlier life. right, something Charles Poliquin also mentioned
learned back day well him, can seem dark bit kind
hopeless, go beyond that. One thing seem appear
look around concepts unique postures. think true
postures thought, emotional postures, movement postures. Truly, earlier
life, creating unique postures get drawers like
language letters. Later life, process moves towards integration
unique postures different organizations. beauty can use
postures create many possibilities, just like lib needs search language
contain one symbol versus two, discovered. something


often seen, like take someone moves certain way teach
new sports techniques, essentially look deeply
sensitive, see postures will work till end
life, thinking postures. really problematic, not freeing
mind beyond this, say, scaffolding thinking actually
letting go content. get focused way thinking versus
thinking itself, habitual ways forms thinking, associated thinking, et cetera.
emotionally same, constructing emotional postures
go rest lives working that. So, dark side, right?
course, always possibilities, think invading early system,
extent, even 5%, 7%, whatever percent, also freeing
going beyond postures period. Working postures have, towards
postureless way things. So, something interesting work people
work movements, finally able go movement magic starts
happen, techniques fall apart something appears, face
change, transformation, binary moment. jump sure,
rare see thinking, emotionally, ways, many
names it. talk enlightenment talk kinds
processes related it. think shadows sun, not

use something called slice dice problem using words,
definitions, categories, try create lot write paper

geeking important, also important let go. tell
people forgot not same, forgetting not never knowing it.
crumbling throwing away form forgetting, leaves kind
homeopathic trace behind. So, take slice dice, try look it.

Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring

want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,

certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,

Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,

opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring

want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological

Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly

they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say

motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,

far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer

create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate

US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made

important intellectual endeavors movement endeavors, understand
correctly, bring oneself place real challenge regular basis. fact, earlier
today, state constant challenge 'cause new me. much
told myself, "Beginners' mind, beginners' mind, beginners' mind," hard, confess,
not want well, perform well, right? think natural healthy thing.
Yet- - Not natural, necessary, want keep side bring
something balance it. not challenge, process will not work.

striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute

help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution

suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one

something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't

definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want


achieve, also letting go deambitioning it. within

again, stretch far away, increase one much,
issues, will practice learn recognize optimal point
progression. course, takes many years lot play exposure get
sense it, regardless layer applied. So, sure field
pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,

communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully

talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement

kind dynamic sleeve can move long not

then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best

02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

went overboard, not present, don't nothing here. Nothing truly
interested in, just gratifying myself, wankery. essence, not searching
discomfort, marker. think question
serving? 'Cause people not serve themselves, essence, serve part, parts it,
kind fraction themselves. separation oneself oneself,
also result practice, good practice. think maybe biggest gift
received practice can say although will take maybe certain context,
not friend. times am, many times not friend. creating
separation, can assume certain stability face everything way
mortality death, is, maybe beyond, knows? - Yeah,
striking moment earlier today really challenged one
practices doing, said, "This exactly experienced morning,
Andrew," said. couldn't imagine challenges
attempting do. course, were, believe
referring put edge earlier day
making failures, failing execute way attempting execute
movement. just inject neuroscience neuroplasticity there, can't
help myself, all. beautiful data animals humans
showing seconds minutes failed attempt motor execution
something, forebrain heightened state focus. hear it,
suddenly makes perfect sense, course, nervous system change unless
got cue change? cue almost always comes form frustration,
[imitates buzzer] said earlier, nah, nah signal [Ido laughing] one
preps extract learning subsequent trials. yet, lot
people, feel ugh, failure execute, even approximate execution
feel experience ah negative signal, lean practice,
start depart either mentally physically both. anything think
perhaps can offer understanding edge people call
failures aren't just necessary, part learning process, entry
gate neuroplasticity. - Yes, contextualizing recontextualizing sensation
something work lot just remind people also reminded myself,
wasn't difficult didn't need redo again, wouldn't
correct scale, dynamic moving just like rolling downhill. So,
definitely necessity succeed, orient, certain aspects want


achieve, also letting go deambitioning it. within
tension, plus minus comes movement, it.
again, stretch far away, increase one much,
issues, will practice learn recognize optimal point
progression. course, takes many years lot play exposure get
sense it, regardless layer applied. So, sure field
pursuits, already aware applying life, talking focus,
talking ways thinking, creativity, et cetera. enough pull
another perspective will see people specialists, don't
really real essence concept. not theirs, applied specifically.
one changes time gets general component appears
everything changes? new entity. Everything changes, something stays.
want get,

00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution

concept understanding. - heard statement before, just
meat vehicle, right? just sack cells truly despise statement
because, first all, deprives us meaning lives. can go
route philosophy whether not meaning not, importantly,
divorces us idea body brain interconnected least
equal value one moment informing other. Emotions inform
movement, movement informs emotions. One thing heard say before,
really love hear embellish important principle human beings
truly unique terms enormous range movements can perform. yet,
excellent, maybe superior species certain types movement.
one comes mind walking, strides, striding. So, maybe just explore
idea obviously cheetah fast, gibbon seems lot
proficiency grabbing swinging branches, human beings perform
enormous can potentially perform enormous array movements. think
human beings potentially able explore different types movement?
so, one approach that? So, basically tabling concept,
not range motion, right, gym rats, discard range motion,
talking variety movements. - First, not important think,


possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds

get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear

not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling

walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

possible not possible, even possible not possible you,
important truly want do, truly after. important
many times, way thinking things already limited. like say
man doesn't go ocean empty spoon. lot types dressing
concepts nowadays trying fit elephant hole needle, yeah? Like
example, concept practice, lives, life.
kind stream behaviors, argument free will, et cetera.
multiplicity, definitely man legion, real meaning phrase.
One day wake like this, say, "Andrew, meet tomorrow 7:00 am,"
don't know going wake tomorrow. send text message,
"Oh, feeling off," right 6:55 go back sleep. So, examining seeing
think frees eventually start orient better direction. So,
want what, orientation also need do,
sense, developing evolutionary direction you,
important bit. possible everyone engage certain specific physical
movement? example, Scandinavian countries, squat not approachable,
difficult. built dragging heavy things also climate,
guess it, makes less sense squat 'cause going freeze there. So,
see squat warm climates like open accessible.
good deadlifters usually, not good squatters the- - want get
away ground. - Yeah, shallow hip socket, allows one activity,
stability deep hip socket architecture hip, femur heads, Q angles,
shapes, et cetera. So, unique certain elements, like,
example, squat challenge like people something there, but- -
remind people squat challenge is? - squat attempt
bring new, fresh state mind word squat, not strength element,
fundamental resting position really. Actually, one abundant ones,
replaced sitting, not really doesn't work well natural
environment, not comfortable actually sit long periods time, rocks
different terrains end lying down, standing, squatting lot. Also,
moving low dynamic, like even collecting berries, squat much
dynamic open. elimination happening there, like
fundamental thing totally eliminated it. eliminated many things,
overhead movements, behind back, kinds back realm call back realm


totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,

sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create

create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited

01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate

looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point

virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

totally absent people's awareness. So, attempt bring back
people, recommended order really get transformation, going
accumulate 30 minutes day squat position, unloaded, just resting down, not
correct, not erect, many people make mistake, didn't read whole
thing. just resting there. course, mindful dosages.
people will get hurt try quickly might need buildup
process towards it. also, not talking 30 minutes straight, accumulation
throughout day. lot good digestive problems, lower back
pain, hip pains, knees, generally aging basically folding
body basic way. folding body? not folding body,
will lose foldability body. probably easiest
abundant way fold body. So, example something can
useful many, many people, will always unique individuals needs
something else. benefits examining things also benefits
getting hurt, not often discussed, especially not parts. So, one
ones teacher says, "I injured many students." not that,
totally useless well. totally safe system nothing offer,
practically nothing totally safe. can, course, don't approach
ballsy machoistic thing, aware sometimes go beyond
boundaries hopefully small injuries will help us avoid big
injuries. try avoid small injuries, maybe get big injuries
there. So, examining types forms movement, location body,
speed execution, type organization body, whole thing
can discuss. grabs something create
individual relationship with, hopefully good guidance, can get right
scenarios, facilitator good scenarios learning, try do.
less technical state mind, ABC or, yeah, like chunking really dislike
long time like many people tell me, "Have met guy?
amazing teacher chunked process bits not even
correct places chunk," like doesn't offer, locks us, state mind.
talk chemistry model, call chemistry model atom, molecule,
compound conceptualized versus just chunking. So, actual
evolution like call also sketch learning. not going try draw you, know
anything art drawing, going start capturing something rough.


need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

need practice first, dynamic entity, go rendering
shading, et cetera. So, way learn things, big picture, small details.
unlike many teachers ran into, say, greatest respect
don't know taught more, good teachers worst teachers,

00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change

just teach small details big picture never arrives. -
Given humans can generate broad array types movement, run, jump,
duck, squat, leap, types movements. think value
observing movements animal species? know certainly enjoy watching
animals move. think most, one spectacular animal facts
shared graduate student, someone hall working
little pedals chameleon, can walk walls. great
mystery whether not suction, turns can vacuum,
not suction. Whether not sticky substance turned out,
don't know, feel compelled share going
feeling will lead us insight sort, little tiny pedals thin
close together chameleon actually sticks wall called
van der Waals forces, meaning weak molecular force, strong enough
stick wall actually exchanging molecules surface
on. - Wow. - So, obviously can't that, yet spent hours,
lab next door, watching videos little chameleon walk articulation
feet incredible literally rolling little pedals along way
kind defies anything else ever seen. told useful, A,
thought interesting, but, B, never really thought
articulate foot. thought heel striker toe striker run
no one can tell one supposed be. maybe can tell me, [Ido
laughing] point is, suppose question is, think value
observing extremes animal kingdom movement way inform play space
exploration space human movement practice? - think so. think,
first, inspiring, opens up, will take away romantic point view.
offer another way examine movements exist us ways, certain
ways. Like work Gracovetsky spine, "The Spinal Engine", see


old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine

immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

old ways moving even way exoskeletons like primary,
ancient even single cell things still within us certain extent. then,
course, gets developed like Darwinian state mind got stuck many years
survival fetus. actually, believe, always believed saw
information lately mutation heart model, not survival
fittest. - Yeah, people often hear word mutation think, "Oh, mutations
bad." maladaptive mutations adaptive mutations, sure. -
then, places word change heart it, wants do, change. So,
not want become better, inherent change it. then, course,
become better X, Y, Z, fittest secondary perspective arrives relation
certain things, still stronger, ancient driving force process.
So, me, cool see animals take way extreme,
also still reflecting within us. So, love do, like example, introduce people
spinal waves, bringing waves body, sometimes get weird
experiences like emotional releases sometimes, times can become
incredible tool help athlete specialized reach top top.
then, defrag system little bit offer freshness
segmental movement. first fuck up, usually case. Technically
off, coordination off, later growth will arrive. form playfulness,
form examining things regardless success failure. understanding
change important that, can also look competitive state
mind success failure orientation, no game without
change. So, primary one, say, "Okay, want succeed
tasks like earlier, stayed within game, sustain game,
infinite versus finite game perspective." sustain game means continue
change, continue transform, win game sometimes mean game over.

01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution

So, like, yeah, within tension think beautiful play, exist, be. -
mentioned something incredibly important concept couple
reasons, mentioned spinal waves. Right, assume taking
torso us, know, movement morons just refer coarse terms
thoracic spine. So, mean, will stay away technical anatomy torso


creating movement either side side undulation arching extension spine. -
Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around
spine, spine us, know, like can take arm off, limb,
attempts, no brainy alone, cerebral thing alone, spine maybe
parts n-systems inside torso important. So, like start
core entity. little fluctuations create, unblock things,
start move things. can avoid, funny enough, mobilizing areas
big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big
frame, big frame doesn't offer small frame because, course, small
detail come together big picture. So, want place body specific
position bits moving well, can construct whatever way want.
just work big one, chances just mobilize certain areas
areas totally held blocked specialized one time. Take
realm difficulties. will sit stagnation? Emotion,
material, thoughts, traumas. people get discharges. body memory not
think is, believe, stored lot everywhere,
experiences. lot people opposite. certain emotion evoked,
start undulate spine. So, can worked direction
direction. believe applying practice, wise, basically turn
lens allowing things shift, move, adapt. So, highly


recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement

sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not

then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side side, rotational well spiraling. - ever
experience people engaging types movements
experiencing particular categories emotions? particular reason
asking this, no right wrong answer, course, just curious whether
not movement call core body, things close midline opposed
far away midline like digits far. any, evidence
can evoke certain category emotional states? - Evidence, none,
experience thoughts it. Ida Rolf known created
Rolfing structural integration said, "The issues tissues." around

big frame motions, competitive motions, techniques life. So, even
yogis, example, look extremely mobile, actually going
small, call small frame, borrowed Chinese martial arts, small
frame, big frame. big frame big changes total body space posture.
small frame barely moving, mobilizing little bits comprise
pretty much posture. So, beneficial totally disappeared
physical culture. introduce back, small frame offers big

recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move

mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem

take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

recommend teach elaborate gradual way. needed
really people, just go like general recommendation,
usually just get stuck new pattern, "Ah, spinal wave, okay, it." So,
using, again, slice dice-like teaching dozens systems moving
torso person freed really move torso like language created,
small enough units created understanding systems
improvise, reach highest level practice. - love answer. Let tell
bit asked. So, principle neuroscience, especially
neuroevolution, call evo-devo sometimes, evolution development,
link. look at, motor neurons, know, audience,
live spinal cord cause transmission contraction muscles, allows us
move limbs. then, motor neurons called upper motor
neurons control motor lower ones. So, something reflexive learned,
not thinking it, speak, mainly use lower motor neurons.
know can experiment, rather barbaric experiment,
done many times called creating decerebrate cat. actually remove
neocortex cats will walk treadmill, called fictive motion, no problem
all. human beings don't neocortex much neocortex
missing, generate perfectly fine movement. - pattern download. -
right, truly downloaded spine connection
spine muscles. Now, motor neurons control spinal waves, called
them, particular category. molecular signature, physiological
signature, identified by, dead now, biologist Columbia University
named Tom Jessell, many scientific offspring. interesting, fish
animals really opportunity undulate flap little fins.
Though, motor neurons control undulation animals identical molecularly
motor neurons control spinal undulation humans. added
human evolution extra rows, literally categories, molecularly distinct neurons
move center body outward, unlike fish, can move
fins, can't actually, doesn't digits. special motor neurons move
little bits, bits, bits, can't spinal wave, can
mudras thing, like belly thing. - Ah-ha. - comes seeing movie "E.T."
kid puffing stomach [Ido laughing] realizing
wave it, one direction and- Okay. - apparently not up. Anyway,


yogis can chuckle that, but. - yogis actually side. - Oh,
they? - Yeah. - don't know can that. Anyway, spinal wave weak,
work it. find interesting layers of, don't want say
sophistication, evolution came addition pools opportunity.
motor neuron pools, called, opportunity engage new,
elaborate types movement. new pool became opportunity create
combinations new movement. so, reason asked spinal waves
create one category movement touch fish one side body,
moves opposite side, never moves toward it. earlier
practice, somewhat similar testing similar reflex. sometimes someone will
move toward touch, don't deviate opposite side. So, untested,
least formally tested hypothesis movements small digits portions distal,
called, far midline body parts evoke different sensations, maybe even
far subtle sensations movements core body stuff closer
spine. Again, just theory, grateful answer lands
least general vector direction idea here. - central orientation mostly
gone culture, don't even walk basically days. look traditional
culture, amount walking rest day, huge. so, started
create technologies bring everything periphery, controlling
fingertips, et cetera. So, incredible neurological development relating this,
central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using
connections running ancient systems. Hence, much limited
gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

central patterns, swimming, running, jumping, throwing, throwing not pushing
away, example, right? - Like people give ball throw,
can tell never thrown ball before. - Yeah, throw like girl. -
Yeah, don't just- - often said [Andrew laughing] US. it's,
course, unfair, relates experience, right? less maybe promoted offered
females, get peripheral pattern instead central-generated pattern
progresses towards extremities. One thing wanted ask know area
not often mentioned ancient patterns systems primary
many ways, hence newer developments inside us constrained using

gene pool. hitchhikers piece DNA, like say, gene pool
like driving something primary even kind driver's seat
eyes, actually not



01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises

ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement

then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best

talking earlier, hack mind something

02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.

movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading

thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,

think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement Language, Consilience

totally constrained that. wanted hear this. - Yeah,
recently guest podcast named Erich Jarvis, professor
Rockefeller, offered position dance Alvin Ailey dance company.
So, accomplished dancer comes musical family chose become
neuroscientist instead study speech language. - Wow. said something
incredible, several incredible things, really looking forward getting reflections
on. First all, said look species kingdom animals,
including us, elaborate language true song, also capacity
dance. the... turns hummingbirds actually dance song capacity.
perhaps, going idea now neuroscience evolution brain,
singing actually came finally articulated speech language, voice
involved first sing, communicate. mean, enunciate ugh, uh, mm.
know, song may come first. song, dance
capacity dance, course movement body.
song dance, always find species can generate elaborate language.
Now, simple version okay, sophisticated brains tend create clusters
sophisticated capabilities, possibility, one Jarvis proposes
think line perhaps raising idea movement
body range sophistication movement body
different systems may actually promoted even driven evolution things
think speech language ability multiple words
concept, elaborate articulation speech. find incredibly attractive
idea certainly hierarchy needs, needed move first
survive, mate, flee, attack. makes perfect sense
layers built fundamentally body mind not way
around. So, one piece, piece, just share
reflections might just blew away Jarvis told read,
if, done experimentally, one records EMG, low level
muscular activity larynx pharynx, actually repeating words
read, subtly don't actually speak out, unless sort
neurologic deficit, people have, people mumble read.
tells language movement movement language. So, again,


convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,
paper, put show note caption, guy also happens Harvard named
Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

convergence, basic level love reflections
ideas, want say, just repeating said not nearly precisely
did, think movement either foundation language
language perhaps even defies words? - Mm, [gasps]. Wow, beautiful
perspectives, definitely feel same. lot say singing
dancing well also form ancient programs transmission. Sometimes
ancient practices, mantras. people don't realize
tantric practices, contain form vibrating breathing tied together
elaborate way promote certain effect. something like
ancient times? ingenious. We, even today, need full book
describe something wouldn't work well, like ancient form
transmission. accurate became language, dead
became, less movement entity, less dynamic entity
nature. Yukio Mishima says, "It's corrupting, corrupts us." So, definitely,
definitely conducing force primary force movement
experienced. Every time talk movement, basically, even now spilling
container call is, beyond that. So, applied
dancing, singing, language. no language see primary
mode, nature space, time, things moving. So, think everything moves
direction understanding more, maybe not popular
call movement people connotations, okay, can throw away
word put another word, probably need also like regularly, like
start see end word me. Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
need new word. even word needed
communication specific processes education exchange, important stay
within experiences. important continue promote scenarios
experience primary, open experience, say, not try hold
define overly accurately done throwing away starting again. So, no
winning concept, got winning concept, got nothing. able grab
it, able to, science, right? like, "We got it, got it,"
turns nothing. like time passes feel science becoming
humble things discussed way. really
science do? Report sun came certain amount billions times
tomorrow will come again. statistics. - Yeah, good prediction. - Yeah, yeah,


can go beyond, something inside us can go beyond. Hard
communicate, can't offer right now here, experience thankfully
practice way sense it, feel it, reexamine it, can
talk it, something that. - Edward Wilson, great sociobiologist,
actually founded field sociobiology, E. O. Wilson, call him, Edward Wilson,
beautiful word indeed named book. Actually, word better
book, sorry Wilson, book little bit meandering taste, then, again,
Harvard professor, not me. Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. word
consilience, idea leaping together divergent forms knowledge create
truly valuable concept, love. love because, course, formally trained
scientist, look things mainly lens neuroscience, experience real
observation real. even field medicine, double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trials case studies, n-of-1, right? Not often
discussed, right, mean, H.M., famous example neuroscience patient
no hippocampus informed us process memory indeed
function hippocampus thousands independent experiments
followed. So, can't one, need different forms exploration,
think share belief, may, convergent forms knowledge, eventually
process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know
called English, kinetic capturing motion moving pictures
time. so, placed dots took photos, became kind
moving. discovered something interesting, accuracy
heat sledgehammer increased variants various points became
more, not less. So, wasn't fixed pattern, meta pattern. pattern
adjusted way achieve perfect execution. early findings,
not sure sit everything, sure truth
experience. Basically, self-adjusting dynamic nature system allows
reach constant stable end result open letting go
control. - Mm-hmm, example give fits well one described
recalling experiment. people want look up,

Bence Ölveczky, Hungarian, clearly pronouncing name wrong, know
Bence. remember slide mind's eye, trajectory mapped
movement tennis racket, not limbs Federer case.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

process consilience can eject new concept. yet, challenge,

01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise

again, don't language it, becomes hard transmit. One
things find incredibly, use word again, sticky notion movement
culture. don't know coined phrase, seen circles accounts
around Instagram account others. don't know phrase
coined, idea engaging movement practice others, whether not
dance movement practices dynamic, unpredictability
it. Even like today, two practitioners vastly different levels knowledge
experience movement practice, information, like think, gained
sides. [laughs] So- - 100%. So, one thing heard say before,
really resonated idea people maybe particularly US
concept of, "Oh, yoga friends people dance distinct
family friends, distinct from." pointed out, gathering around movement


age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least
states being, say. Maybe states reached,
stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful
lives. wake morning feel living thing feeling movement,
and, me, result practice. so, easy not stagnate
mind can stay focused hours like done today, can listen tune
won't lose you. difficult, like haven't good conversation
US difficult, attention listening, rare.
rare somebody can that,

01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees Freedom

struggle, always struggle, definitely trick, dirty trick. -
said allowed and, again, taking language report
experience trying map concepts relate neural
circuits. principles neuroscience, talk instructiveness versus
permissiveness. instructive cues, like instance, ability pick
pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system
already generating movement, done flung open gate
allowed movement occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing current,
current, another current, opening window. - Exactly, look
formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.
- [Andrew] No. - brought examine movement habits workers
collected information. placed, one first kinetic, don't know

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point

assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

age-old tradition. perhaps better off not thinking people
exercise train with, friendship connection made movement
perhaps valuable form connection. - Yeah, think product
practices maybe not aware not movement-oriented open sense
get sensation people, alone, nothing, much
never alone also inside will manufacture produce entities
inside, constantly dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. practically,
learned lesson capoeira, cultural manifestation. Things happen within
context, rub reality, rub movement occurs
insight gained development happens comes
thoughts, collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. transmitting knowledge.
go top mountain, 20 people, 20 normal individuals, spent 20
years just fighting four hours morning, four hours afternoon,
20 years, isolated source knowledge, still not reach
anything young fighter days has. will unable develop
techniques, insights, collective knowledge comes transmission
jumps us forward, problem that? Staying within just technical
constraints never making yours, part self-knowledge. digestion
collective information becomes digested becomes part yourselves,
versus it. clear separation can see
sports high level not high level, even though honest
say people reach far just collective knowledge technical
approach, others reach extremely far little it. always
outliers, always outliers case. Another thought
mentioned evo-devo, evolution development also Greek concepts poiesis
physis. growing seed tree, process
manufacturing chair tree. Two processes development evolution,
different. One everything something, nothing something. One
accumulation based, one subtraction based. processes relate
collective knowledge, self-knowledge, not exactly just that.

01:26:36 Potential Movement, “Humming”

do? question friend Rasmus, asks thesis


thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement

kind dynamic sleeve can move long not

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually

avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

thoughts, ultimate us? manufacture chair
grow like tree? Civilize mind, leave savage body. way
mind also left wild? Wild wise nice combination words like
place together, wild, wise. So, something try bring way
live life practice. try bring information, wisdom,
collective knowledge, also try let go essence
gleaned, something appearing everything already there.
example, sitting here, movements already occurring, possibilities
are. So, just about, need open, open window, air come here.
open window, air come. don't need drive motion, need
discover stopping happening. Something constantly holding,
remove immediately movement appears, real deep movement versus
driven movement wasteful times like walking, see people pushing
walk instead controlled falling be. Fighting, punching
manufacture strength someone knows facilitate
conditions knocked out. doesn't knock out, "It hits versus hit,"
like Bruce Lee said. So, beautiful thing examine work within that,
see skateboarding? using perspective? trying to, control
risk danger, trying overly control something actually can never
controlled. way control let go control then, okay,
collection information, knowledge can bring in? want
play? can play can play here. collective knowledge maybe
take in, still going need individual work. lot
people like romanticize don't need teachers, don't need
nothing, don't need information. not fully honest, don't need, depends
want function want function. shouldn't demonized,
shouldn't overly glorified well. - mentioned opportunity
movement, perhaps even forms movement coming deep within, raises
mind neuroscience motor systems talk motor neurons, described,
ones actually evoke contraction muscles. then, category
neurons isn't often discussed, certainly exist. Aren't often discussed kind
popular nomenclature neuroscience, pre-motor system.
movements reflection certain patterns transmission breaking
pre-motor actual motor. words, always anticipatory mode


movement. think you, way describe it, clearly intuitively
understand this, feel it, recognize it. think like layer
neurons constantly humming [hums] ready go. release
gates allows movement occur particular way, smooth,
ballistic. - DNA, same, turning off on, information already
there. - Right. - possibilities just allowed. So, allowed, don't free
will already, allowed do, am. possibilities dancing within
dance, not dancer. So, that's, sensation least

stability will arrive waters, movement waters, humming,
potential possibilities state, vibrate like powerful

pen, right? instruction, clearly motor command, just one
way looking it. way actually works pre-motor system

formal study movement improvement movement, basic example
can give like tennis serve. they, just, done many times
over. map trajectories, novice lines place, ends
looking like tangle rubber band ball, right? Whereas Federer


expert, almost wonder just one line drawn, trajectories
incredibly stereotyped. reflection one little narrow gate opening again,
again, again. course- - Let inject something old neurologist,
can say, Bernstein, Soviet. talked degrees freedom,
order increase productivity Soviet Union. don't know heard story.

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point
moon, look finger, really essence virtuoso, me, like
mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something

plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving

Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made

01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees
freedom opportunity real advancement expansion skill shows
up. think way described go unskilled
skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not
sleeve, still within boundaries achieving result after.
then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.
sleeve not constricted thought, "Oh, beautiful technique."
many ways skin cat, experience, variety, diversity goes
virtuosity. true freedom focus right thing. don't point

mastery, say thing. - Oh, believe thing
flatter attempt embarrass saying think not alone viewing
virtuoso movement. think comes mind
notion not everything pre-planned, even might not know

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

So, think aligns well describing. Yeah, exploration degrees

skilled mastery, top tier, beautiful, thin
layer people occupy, virtuosity, practitioner invites
variability chance back opportunity truly new things. - made
think many years ago, kind thinking entity?
obviously, not technique, wouldn't even honest say movement
pattern, much diversity there. started talk about, called movement


sleeves meta technique, word technique already misleading. So,
kind dynamic sleeve can move long not

then, result adaptation elements inside keep sleeve.

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think

01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness

going next moment execution, projecting
assumptions. like talk mindsets approaching practice little bit
more, want wade territory talking vision eyes, something
share deep interest in. background visual neuroscience,
also realization incredible ability adjust aperture
visual window, can focus narrowly can focus broadly. So,
something encountered, think first child, realizing spend day
watching ants play fine domain look go inside realize
whole world realizing, "Wow, never able consume full range
experiences one moment." ants probably corner room
thing. approach movement can be, mentioned,
big dynamic terms broad movements limbs fine articulation.
begin practice move practice, apply regimented
way focusing vision? panoramic vision? narrow field
view? entirely depend? person true beginner, true
novice, like myself, show practice eyes? - eyes
good starting point help lot people understand. encounter
difficulties layers, powerful start eyes. Another thing
important understand experience, can't believe me, got


examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also

moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast

know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace

examine yourself, not move eyes well think do. 'Cause
long can see move eyes, people never think it, can
trained, can improved, et cetera, effects far reaching. eyes
lead inner eye, can think beautiful metaphorical way.
representation way use various cognitive mind processes also,
course, affect body. eyes lead many ways head also
inputs coming here. So, easy lead body
look centrally head, powerful easy thing. example,
teach boxers bob, usually not done way believe
done, teach periphery. teach feet
idea, correct, need spatial conditions, movement,
space. reality, head will organize feet you. Instead, now
putting two elements together years practice, hope tying
together well. prefer something else pull head now side,
will immediately start organize feet you. So, give just one element
manipulate system from, teach someone something like this.
Many animals hunt head, can see body running forward
head turning side, whole thing follows afterwards. So, powerful
way address movement, not one, many modes, thankfully,
adaptable that, definitely primary one. then, use eyes
is, course, maybe important element usually. Yeah, else can
say eyes? So, come in? Well, depends practice,
need start kind checklist looking do.
this, can start tailor way use eyes. thing
posture, thing stance, thing eventually state.
different flavors, no correct way use eyes. Sometimes
peripheral, soft, open awareness orientation, sometimes focused. Notice
pulling two opposites, awareness focus, often put together fused,
eyes like immediate easiest entry point that.
Another thing placement head eyes, like example,
lower chin, seem see better. raise eyebrows, much
exposure top light sources people usually looking
distance will tilt chin in. many scenarios, tilting chin side,
placing just like listening ear, placing certain eye dominant eye, depending


various scenarios. like information can come cerebrally,
think about, jump practice forward. Instead, just letting experience teach
that, using kind thinking process improve. not cheating,
great. Will work? got try, process. thoughts
start play with. - Yeah, love mentioned chin
natural reflex chin goes down, eyes goes up, opposite true head
goes up, eyes go down. two separate clusters neurons cranial
nerve nuclei that, call them, eyes up, increases level alertness
overall. not woo science, function cranial nerve nuclei.
eyes down, go states calm quiescence. makes
perfect sense, know, eyelids usually go people fall
asleep. Eyes not mean head 'cause, said, dynamic
control amount luminance depending environment. So, then,
mentioned, difference focus awareness, think really
important one. panoramic, soft gaze broad awareness,
big swaths visual field, say, neurons control come
pathway called magnocellular pathway. event, neurons much thicker,
thicker cables, transmit much faster, just like thick pipes can carry water
quickly. reaction time least four times awareness mode
narrowly focused something. counterintuitive, think,
lot people, person running catch ball not tracking ball
smooth movement, vision peripheral vision. drive
peripheral vision reaction times much, much faster. So, don't know
reluctant encourage people shift toward particular type practice toward
particular type vision. think I, hope agree on, correct wrong,
exploring different extremes everything real
value is. Panoramic focused, eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up, playing
exploring opposed first 10 minutes practice
panoramic vision. know, sort of- - Yeah. - earlier today joking
kind lamenting fact word biohacking exists optimal
performance, unfortunate terms suggest just
plug in, going like two plus two equals four going get right
every time. - Another pragmatic bit here, can offer, since culture
geared pushing us towards focus, focus use eyes, primary language,


reading, things, less opportunities work open
panoramic one. So, smart start balance things bit more.
nature, don't look leaf, everything moving, kind
immersed that. then, something attracts attention, "Oh, bird,"
focus, go back general state, base state, open awareness.
Here, switch things around modern culture, mostly focused
sometimes daydream, maybe kind balancing act comes
deep within, don't know, maybe can share information that, see
many time people need to, focus overly done far lives. - couldn't
agree more, think lot even venture far say lot visual
deficits now see young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs
look things close us children adults, eyeball
actually gets longer. lens focuses visual image front nearer lens,
nearsighted, front land. basically, lack panoramic
vision open awareness driving changes. nowadays,
essentially, people 90% time narrow focus mode. know, right
recording, took break went look vista look off
distance, incredibly useful, easy practice level, think people not
sort thing. way shapes mind

01:48:28 Hearing & Movement

perception time, course, whole kingdom ideas. one thing
like relate element vision open awareness earlier mentioned
cone auditory attention, sense can play practice
throughout day. see value paying attention things
narrow cone auditory attention, also just walking listening sounds
once? imagine useful. terms physical movement
practices, going say ears? ears always less
place, hearing approach practice? - Another
set parameters think about, play with, aware of. Also,
experience people better using system system.
amazed differently results seemingly outside results done
different practitioners different scenarios. goes mutation change


idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell
wild wise.

Right. - just reporting functions play it, see

02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually

trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel

excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according

don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set

thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids

touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,

curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal

always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

idea really jumps us forward eventually kind mutation. So, like
culture, practices, success puts us closer closer other,
opinions everywhere around world becoming
same, less less different, real hope comes different,
difficulty promoting that. so, another thing can promoted
right practices, right, example, work corporates even worked
governments bring freshness simple habits
workday, education children, companies increasing productivity. don't
really give fuck, give view important important
maybe increases productivity, important improves people's
lives involved improves, yeah, becoming, becoming,
two entities. not there, way, process. So, thinking
hearing, way people use ears, way people use listening. Again,
can talk placement head posture, sometimes angling well, sharper
angle, chin down, people tend use shape ear, people different
ears closer out. sensitive looking around,
see affecting people's motion. Even shape face, like
development vocal chords speaking will totally change are,
look, listen also will same. don't proof it,
something believe in. - Well, people will even make ears bigger, right? We, try
become like little fennec foxes something by, mean, lot people don't realize
actually capture sound waves, right? leaning
localization sound based simple brainstem calculation interaural
time differences, time something, brain intuitively, just knows 'cause
pretty hardwired circuit sound arrives first ear ear,
likely coming here. Whereas, dead center, arrives two
time, almost ridiculously simple one hears it, no pun intended,

01:52:43 Walking Gaits

incredibly valuable way thinking architecture body
changes experience. Along lines earlier, mentioned something
flagged important question me. see people walking sometimes think,
"Wow, really move strange way." Occasionally see somebody, walk


really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go

Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting

actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,

really, impressive whatever reason, know, just think, "Wow, sort
glide along." People come different shapes sizes, short torsos, long arms, et
cetera. think people body type facilitates certain kinds
movement not others intentionally try move way
right edge kind friction challenge order shape new possibilities,
think lean smooth execution comes
naturally them? - Yeah, think good practice many walks
required. And, course, efficient endurance, stamina-oriented thing
experience, will naturally develops unravel. not, can
get collective knowledge improve. lot emotion,
emotional things related walk like walking business meeting and/or
walking bad situation. lot beautiful things research
practically yourself, trying approach someone chin slightly down,
linear, efficient straightest line, trying approach someone little bit
rounded side tilting head, will see totally different results,
totally different communication happens people's heads. sensitive,
realize that, "Wow, opened door." Instead, many people start
minus. sister, big sister, Atali, always says, "I started minus, don't
start zero them?" know, so, part approach. can affect
that, can start even plus sly man practitioner needs
be. So, something play work have, course,
body proportions, ways, like technical invasions,
mathematics, trigonometry, architecture, invaded bodies, invaded
nervous system. now, walk physical practices, look linear
efficient, path two points straight line, not, biomechanics,
not mechanics, nothing given, no gospel. So, walkers sometimes
go around sway side side, coiling coiling
moving bits. coordination breathing walk?
walk linearly, less pumping air naturally now
forcefully bring out, wasteful. see last years,
incredible runners, especially long distance, things never thought
possible worst possible way used think, pronation kinds things
like technical thoughts totally misguided wrong. then, somebody
comes way totally wrong gets results


never get. beauty playfulness, experimentation, change, different.

01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness

one favorite neuroscientists, university Chicago,
meeting argument evolution nervous system
said, "At end," people arguing whether not gene one animal
homologous gene humans, et cetera, can get dicey. said
very, appropriately that, "One major jobs evolution take existing cell
types circuits give new functions. can done
playful exploration new possibilities," think maps well
saying, extreme thresholds technical execution, know, mastery,
mastery, mastery, you, obviously performance high, opportunity
evolution sport, music, dance, intellectual endeavor limited
not introducing variability. attempt get proper execution,
limiting oneself. - Hence, want offer something relating you.
wary defining mechanisms putting certain meaning certain processes
ways just history experience shows doesn't work well us
times, becomes like much elaborate thing even somewhat
right direction even thinking way can offer lot. Like example,
advice heat, dopamine, light, offers lot benefit, also can create problems
can enclose something improviser will find, MacGyvers, right? Like
take pink, paper clip, make something great. really our,
biggest improvisers around like made us are, think,
incredible can it. know, Russian-American space
exploration story space pen, famous story development space
pen. - don't know. - a- - space pen? - Yeah. - No, don't know this. - think
urban myth. don't know true, like use it. Well, this,
course, space competition Russians put first animal space first.
- macaque monkey something like that, yeah. - Yeah. Laika,
put first Sputnik, satellite, men space, Americans took man
moon. way lot technologies got developed Americans
lack gravity developed space pen huge investment,


Russians used pencil. [Andrew laughing] So, don't know true, don't think
is, represents something state mind. Like look at, example,
military equipment Soviet equipment, can multiple things means
heavier, less efficient, not light, even Navy SEALs will still carry AK
certain conditions, why? can pour whole bucket sand
mechanism will keep running advanced German Heckler & Koch
accurate light weapons, every grain can get stuck overly specialized.
something openness humans need keep, also
maybe something leaders less specialists
openness, less capable way, capable whole thing. -
love story, whether not legend not, legendary fantastic.
say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine
might not useful him. practitioner, make own, go
practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people
prefer will work first time every time will serve best
compared everything else. reliable tools others,
mind, reliable tools tend ones grounded innate physiology
opposed some, don't like word hack, fact, loathe word biohack,
talking earlier, hack mind something
designed one purpose used another, not efficient use
tool, naturally best solution. Whereas, biology good solutions,



02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario

always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better

say, laboratory, whenever someone takes project lab, always say,
"You know, ask much technical detail challenge want
take technology, advanced technology, yes,
opportunity discovery, downtime. PhD will literally take longer
going use microscope commission 30% time, just
understand that." So, dynamic interplay there. - way, think
scientists get right, transmit knowledge scientific field
science debate everything, not connected, course
can happen well, goes simple person without
experience takes gospel, fixed thing, just report. -
Right. - just reporting functions play it, see
you. greatest information can give, person will examine

practice, try heat, cold, light, movement, awareness this, awareness this.
make yours, don't like responsibility. - No, people

talking earlier, hack mind something

02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -


Love it, think wonderful message. keep hearing
people explore, explore, explore. listen, want thank
time today, first all, incredible teachings table, also
introduction movement practice. Although, now tempted say
moving whole life, just didn't know was- - true. - vast
landscape. Also, willingness tread journey truly unique.
know, greatest compliment one can give science one going
tell now entirely appropriate, say n-of-1, right?
truly are, don't think anyone willing embrace
existing practices, evolve them, create new practices, share broadly really
willing give teach much knowledge. know, earlier made
mention goals part wild wise, tell

02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity Others, Play & Discomfort

don't always work, not every time. Earlier today, practice
involved invasion, shall say, peripersonal space. weren't standing super
close particular reason, God forbid- - God forbid. -
close enough together touch one torsos
part practice. encouraged pay attention feel
someone peripersonal space? then, notion reactivity. find
immensely interesting potentially powerful practice think lot people,
know lot people suffer anxiety just face-to-face conversation.
people lot anxiety physically close people, whether not
know not. many people reactive, anticipatory state
something going happen. sometimes relates trauma negative
experience, sometimes no, sometimes just not used dynamic,
excuse me, exchange beings. so, one thing love
movement practice dynamic one can explore space. Maybe
talk little bit more. - Yeah. Touch, proximity, things, also
taking very, takes very, think, limited place lives. People not touched
don't touch enough. certain bubbles peripersonal space according
culture, according environment, right, wrong? came the,
course, political correctness, harassments, kinds. problem,
problem navigate scenario. think are, definitely side
suffering. People go BJJ classes touch, not learn BJJ. it,
not even aware it, go prostitute, maybe. not honest
say that, yeah, not required necessary lives. Children
not touched, lot information problems, adults
not touched, not lot information. think no less problem
something constantly present. then, proximity able
to, said, remove certain reactivity learn control volume control
reactive am, scenarios, remove reactivity altogether
important performance also lives clear thinking, et cetera,
everything moving us monitored us everything
potential detract us certain direction exploration
reactive, slave, becomes worse worse worse. as,


example, fighter, football player, et cetera, know take, not
take. fact can sense doesn't mean react it.
practice helps bringing people scenarios, oftentimes disarming
them. Like working closely today, certain
background boxing fighting, can tell you, missing kind way
space not marshaled. So, carry certain tone, although
kind person, oftentimes held without realizing holding
lot strength, example, just, clear not fully aware
unfolding just, course, question experience. So, able
scenario, something else, not geared towards winning, losing
competition, just able play another person. Like example, contact
improvisation took played that, work Steve Paxton ones
not familiar. So, call hybrids become useful, like
don't practicing open way, not bound specific rule set
ways things. can fight, can dance moment after. Another
thing learned capoeira situation's tricky 'cause seen kids
cartwheels Brazil scissors fall pocket. Why, go
scissor pocket? Obviously, certain intentions
times see back flips beautiful things, people die capoeira every year. -
Neck breaks something? - Kicks face various violence.
explored martial arts boxing, involved MMA BJJ, tell
violent arenas vibe 'cause unknown. One moment, smiles, another
moment, something else uncontrolled. no categories, no weights,
street phenomenon. So, musical instruments, sometimes break
head. People don't see that, can look online YouTube see
side capoeira, actually day-to-day Brazil reality
things unfolded. So, important explore many ways within
different distances spaces people touched different ways not
contextualizing always way. can touch chest one way, can touch
exact pressure speed, will feel different. parameters,
not sure, certain intentions, certain combination postures ways,
beautiful exploration. again, encourage others explore
discomfort. example, certain discomfort man certain scenario
woman trying see that? truly strong, not afraid


anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way
puts nervous system state readiness reactivity can exacerbate
problems. Whereas, clear literature trauma trauma relief
way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving

anything. truly know exploration, don't know
end result, research not afraid debt
this, don't come boundaries, will improve culture
tremendously. course, must agreement, never force yourself,
meet someone also interested exploration it.
many scenarios traditional practices, like learning grapple going
contact improvisation studying there, going dance, Latin dance class
is, course, favorite create come hybrids
scenarios. Communicating loved one movement, not sitting
around food talking, moving together kinds ways. Sometimes walking
together, sometimes kinds of, can game, playful, can romantic.
many shades, sex doesn't start end here, right? like continuum,
don't even need define way. So, time, think unlocks lot
things. People become much stronger good sense, sense becoming, being,
abuse less, can approach, yeah, aspects us. - love idea
exploration range physical contacts provided one knows can
always return center, speak, lot opportunity opens up.
wish encouraged children's play, also, mentioned,
adult environments. yeah, nowadays sorts reasons
touched on, idea keeping least arms length distance become critical.
lot environments actually hugging not allowed. don't know
like Israel, states many institutions not allowed touch anyone
else's body. actually wonderful study comes mind Israeli
laboratory, guy named Noam Sobel, there, shown
recording people's first interactions people meet, shake hands,
almost always, think greater 85% time will wipe chemicals
person onto eyes, typically eyes face.
changed little bit whole pandemic thing, thought carryover
animals terms exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging
chemicals constantly feeding subconscious chemical knowledge
chemical constituents people, right? So, goes way beyond people
smell, look, et cetera. touch seems just, said, provided
consensual, seems like just really good thing overall. - think maybe also
important discharging, discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. So,


like touches, powerful that. touched touching lot,
unpacking experience touch maybe traumatic
reframing it, opportunity, something interesting. heard
story traditional culture burned mistake,
immediately burn again. made think, not
burn marks not side effects, claim.
made think like, "What's source this?" realized maybe allows
certain completion happen traumatic moment not there. So, re-
exposure, still open, pores still open, allows reframe
experience unfolding rest event different.
touching practice day-to-day, working people,
touched, people come closer, away, happens naturally. Yeah,
pass certain limit becomes much, always, course,
communication present. Certain cultures make communication pre,
certain cultures post. Israeli, example, post, pre. - Ah, Israel,
say, "That didn't feel good me," or, "That felt good," or, "That fine." - Yeah,
common. airport, guys telling me, "I'm going slide
hands towards crotch meet hard stop," way
supposed show me, no enjoyment just feels
aggressive. intention good, showing me. loving touch,
nicer actually, personally gentle, goes
shows me, "I no enjoyment this." [groans] testicle right there,
different choices. [Andrew laughing] don't think like worse, description can
bit dissociated. make think? truly feels not?
'Cause feels robotic, not. So, sometimes rather not say going
touch chest just place hand chest. And, course I, can't avoid
problem, not suggesting is, examination.
moved around around world, seen many things seen benefits
benefits there. practice, think important discuss this, examine
this, don't solution, something talk about. - something talk
about, glad raised think clear much
value movement practice involves dynamic interaction somebody else.
pointed out, can performed one's practiced throughout one's day.
unpredictability key element it, bringing potential


described. reference notion trauma burn re-burn.
colleague Stanford, David Spiegel, works trauma actually
podcast, voiced things like trigger warnings way

way deal controlled, clearly controlled re-exposure
trauma order diminish emotional response time. mean, clear
avoid thing, obviously don't want re-injure re-traumatize,
one avoids thing makes upset over, serve create
heightened state readiness, primes trauma. - Yeah. - So, think makes
good sense. - think impressions useful also stepping area
trauma can occur. then, going impression already
occurred, create kind thermal layer protection, already hit
entering space, beneficial. already touched way
didn't like go contact improvisation class, just running scenario
head

02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback

protects well, yeah. - glad mentioned running scenarios head.
curious day whether not visualization mental rehearsal
physical movement. seems popular idea states, people
always asking me, "You know, can just imagine movement learn better
actually perform it?" hunch based understanding
scientific literature visualization can useful extent people
good visualization, many people, doesn't help. nothing
like real physical practice improve physical practice. - Yeah, word visualization's
not good, obviously, experientialization complete way, not just
visually, course. unless already developed certain experience, tangible
experience benefited feedback, outside feedback. not
useful thing do, ends fabrications. experienced
already gained benefit burnt overextended here,
certain experience can strengthen certain aspects it, got
careful not feedback. missing feedback,


might develop delusions. might develop stronger patterning, ultimately
lead away aliveness movement itself. Drilling, example,
useful learn general infrastructure movement sleeve technique,
dress up,

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
define myself. human being, don't sense worth, already like
geared towards need this, need prove this, agenda.
get lies world problems difficulties. So,
practices, related prove this, that, way, need muscles X,
Y, Z. lot reported outcomes often place like funny. hear


something like heard say gratitude practice actually experiencing
outside somebody else, receiving gratitude actually powerful.
true, see true, not sure everybody sees. somebody tries feel
gratitude, just sit eyes clothes watch movie sense gratitude there,
will clear you, one difficult easy. Hence,
gratitude achieved easier way, works like that. Although
traditional practices challenging sense gratitude
yourself, achieve much powerful thing, not research people
people research, don't lot people. So, lot things
can arrive us, weight training, benefits, way hormonal effect,
effect cognition, et cetera. open bit go far out, see
certain things, not truth, maybe less delusion. nothing definite,
something maybe wholesome appears. Yeah, think
state, state exploration. don't want thought already it,
want thought? already it. don't want
practice, don't want to. curled already way, want experience something
else, want to. benefit gain, No, better. better better,
not more, not faster. like better better, better isn't, don't know better
is, right? So, like open. Oh, better, don't know. just weight,
one kilo, maybe remove one kilo, discover something like, example,
power development shown gain certain benefits lighten
load accelerated certain conditions, discovered it?
practitioner, math person, not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, reported something,
already within grasp practitioners. think, researcher,
powerful remind work that. practitioner,
living human being, everyone, think something useful. then,
plays doing, people give weird looks, like yeah, tell people,
"You don't want normal. don't get weird looks, not moving
right direction." moving fixed already know result
direction, say least that. So, continue play that, continue play. Look
elsewhere, look places didn't look still like within
layer, one foot front, one foot behind, happens smile,
workout, frown? happens, breath holding
blood restrictions, great play, think beneficial do, go through. -

02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination

need feedback, need alive, need receive something corrective. -
love it. many people, approach movement form weight training,
yoga, running. Yoga's bit dynamic, fairly linear types exercise
movement, Peloton, rowing, kinds things. think people will probably not
depart practices entirely like them. speaking myself,
like much, enjoy them. terms thinking adding
movement practice one's already existing exercise regime, can imagine threading
throughout day, can imagine dedicated movement practice. One thing
started basis teachings, just sort created
idea rather statically standing lifting weights, actually walking from,
alternate repetitions, occurred never done curl, bicep curl
one foot front other, never actually switched up. kind
odd stance standing parallel curling one's arm, kind ridiculous
movement one thinks it. So, started incorporating that, get
strange looks gym, just give strange looks back. So,
thoughts [Ido laughing] linear forms exercise? And,
encourage people expand play space, were, kinds exercise?
think movement practice just best explored three dimensionality,
gravity, maybe stick ball? - Hmm, definitely problem,
approachable. People want quick, people want hack, people want icing,
no cake. no cake, just like industries icing, icing, icing what?
putting on? So, that, going towards side, like
life, now tell movement practices pursue. movement,
essence, not thinking serious way eyes.
dynamic entity you, body huge part communicating, genetic
layers, personalities got developed built around various influences,
also kind essence, something reeks within


cells. grew family grew family still
same, something always try think about, inside
me? So, think practices, good, not designed goal
think designed it, orients towards something else.
example, yoga, good book called "Yoga Body", will destroy lot
people's yoga practice. goes get yoga, influence
Swedish gymnastics Mongolian contortionists, Western, West affecting
it, ancient practice, barely asana-related, posture, position. So,
actually said yoga less linear, yoga linear, linear days,
lines. Look traditional dances, look like nothing like yoga. Look tai
dance, look Chinese dances, martial arts, rounded, curved, like
like nature, see nature movement animals. So,
come from? things understand designs now,
shapes you. placing forces change streams
change, good intention, just want that, joke us.
movement practice first education, start think this.
nothing can just sprinkle now, magic powder will help resolve
start deep investigation. then, things, talk
pragmatically, described not placing foot front
curling, examination, good direction.
then, will need another one, another one, don't get stuck foot front
try eyes closed different head posture, will see
things arrive, unrelated things associative mind, thinking, relates,
doesn't get heart it, never. So, just infusing elements like cup will
create endless combinations, possibilities, lot discovery.
humility practitioner. don't know, try like today you., tried various
combinations oh, discover something, oh, is, playful approach,
researcher approach. don't try fit truth something,
examine. don't motive yet, why? fine, don't depend
