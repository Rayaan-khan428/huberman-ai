also talk focus attention everybody's ability focus attend not
just people ADHD. also going talk tools allow anyone,
whether not ADHD not enhance level concentration focus.
Now, ADHD used called ADD Attention Deficit Disorder. record ADD


medical literature dating back early 1904. Now nothing special
1904. just first time showed standard medical literature.
believe ADD, now call ADHD existed 1904 probably
long 1904, why? Well, strong genetic component.
close relative ADHD, much higher probability will ADHD
probability goes depending closely related person
happen be. instance, identical twin twin ADHD,
high concordance say, high probability will ADHD
75% chance. fraternal twin ADHD, number goes bit
50 60% range on. parent ADHD, number ranges
anywhere 10 25% likelihood, will ADHD two parents
on, okay? genetic component genetic component
turns out, relates directly specific neural circuits brain wire up,
chemicals use way use chemicals, topic going
discuss depth today. Now, close relative ADHD, not mean
faded ADHD happen ADHD, ways
overcome symptoms lack attention, impulsivity on. Another important
point ADHD nothing intelligence, whether not
talking intelligence measured standard IQ test rather controversial issue
many probably know, lots forms intelligence standard IQ test
just wouldn't pick emotional intelligence, musical intelligence, spatial intelligence,
sorts intelligences. None related ADHD. high functioning
doesn't make likely ADHD ADHD doesn't necessarily mean
low IQ. people ADHD low IQs people
ADHD high IQ, people ADHD high emotional IQ low IQ
emotional scale, place. important point ability attend
focus not relate smart IQ type, not just
standard IQ. renaming ADD ADHD took place mid late 1980s
psychiatric community psychological community started taking better
notice fact so-called hyperactive kids also attentional issues. might
seem obvious, extensive ongoing revision criteria
designating psychiatric disorder still ongoing process even today.
mid eighties, started hearing ADHD gradually term ADD
dropped away. However, just renaming ADD ADHD led much


better diagnosis detection ADHD. right now current estimates
one 10 children probably ADHD. current estimates
anywhere 10%, one 10 high 12%. Now, fortunately half
will resolve proper treatment, half typically don't. thing
seeing lot nowadays increased levels ADHD adults
question whether not adults ADHD went undetected
childhood whether not ADHD now cropping adulthood due way
interacting world particular smart phone use, combination email,
text, real-world interactions, multiple apps streams media social media
coming trying manage life. things going creating
kind cloud poles attention question whether not
creating ADHD adults never ADHD

00:13:00 Attention & Focus, Impulse Control

prior adult. talk attention first just define
mean attention scientific literature discussions ADHD,
will hear things like attention focus concentration impulse control
sake today's discussion, attention, focus, concentration essentially
thing, okay? split hairs scientific literature split hairs these.
want understand biology want straightforward
conversation ADHD, say attention focus, basically referring
thing, unless specify otherwise, okay? people ADHD trouble holding
attention. attention? Well, attention perception. perceiving
sensory world. just little bit neurobiology 101, sensing things time.
information coming nervous system time. instance, right now
hearing sound waves. seeing things, sensing things
skin, paying attention ones paying
attention perceptions. hear voice, perceiving voice.
not paying attention senses moment, okay? might even
outside breeze said that, might not perceiving breeze,
body sensing along. attention focus less
thing, impulse control something separate impulse control requires
pushing putting blinders sensory events environment. means


lack perception, impulse control limiting perception. People ADHD
poor attention high levels impulsivity

00:14:57 Hyper-focus

easily distractable. way shows surprising. might think
people ADHD just simply can't attend anything. really can't focus, even
really want to, simply not case. People ADHD yes,
distractable. Yes, impulsive. Yes, easily annoyed things happening
room. sometimes high level emotionality well. Not always,
often however people ADHD can hyper focus incredible ability focus
things really enjoy intrigued by. Now, important
point typically think somebody ADHD really wild
hyperactive, no ability whatsoever sit still attend
phenotype call contour behavior cognition can exist, many people,
not people ADHD, give something really love, like child
loves video games child loves draw, adult loves particular type
movie person much, will obtain laser-focus without effort. tells
us people ADHD capacity attend, can't engage
attention things don't really, really want know much
life, whether not child adult involves lot things don't
want do, much schooling involves things prefer not
sort forcing it, attend, even though not super interested
attending to.

00:16:45 Time Perception

couple things people ADHD display quite often. One
challenges time perception. Now time perception fascinating aspect
brain works later going talk time perception can actually
get better time perception. likely right now things get
way optimal time perception will tell adjust ability
measure time brain. People ADHD often run late. often
procrastinate, interesting surprising given deadline,


actually can perceive time well often can focus well
consequences not completing task not attending severe enough. little bit
like way people ADHD can really focus like something. Well,
scared enough consequences not attending, oftentimes not always,
oftentimes can attend. not really concerned deadline
consequence, well, tend lose track time tend underestimate
long things will take. Now many people that, not just people ADHD,
people ADHD challenges, understanding line activities
day order meet particular deadlines even just simple thing, like finishing one
set tasks lunch, oftentimes will remember lunch starts noon,
somehow aren't able fill intervening time way productive
can obsess

00:18:25 Pile System

upcoming deadline instance, will talk remedy this. addition,
spatial organization skills often subpar, not always, often will find
somebody ADHD uses called pile system order organize things,
will take many belongings kitchen bedroom
office space will start piling things according
categorization system makes sense them. doesn't really
logical framework. Now, many people use pile system use pile
system, doesn't mean ADHD fact, unpacking house
moved recently, received lot presence recently, pile system
makes perfect sense organize space. people ADHD tend organize
things according pile system time pile system doesn't work
them. Okay, key distinction use filing system, not really
files, piling things way makes sense them, doesn't work
terms tasks actually need perform. can't find things
anyone moves one thing disruptive overall plan
overall plan doesn't really work first place. common phenotype
call it. phenotype way, just expression particular set underlying
genetic psychological components, okay? say phenotype. phenotype
can brown hair green eyes, like me,



00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
people pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, probably
remember minute now without writing down. add one
number 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, gets tougher, okay? reason phone
numbers typically seven digits them, course, area code,
remembering information strings longer seven numbers sentence
two challenging people, people ADHD severe challenges, even
much smaller batches information even much smaller batches time.
Deficits working memory also something see people
frontotemporal dementia, damage frontal lobes age-related cognitive decline
will come no surprise later discuss treatments, supplements,
tools ADHD, many treatments, supplements tools
ADHD similar ones work age-related cognitive decline. Okay,
less established kind menu items people ADHD tend
them. just subset them. severity can range
intense mild, general, challenges attention focus, challenges
impulse control, get annoyed easily. kind impulsivity,


can't stay task. Time perception can off, use piling system system
doesn't work well order organize things physical space
hard time anything mundane not really interested in.
again, just want highlight people ADHD able obtain heightened
levels focus, even hyper-focus things exciting really
want engage in. now contour ADHD is,
somebody doesn't ADHD, also asking aspects
ADHD similar things experienced before. know
healthy brain also range abilities focus. people focus
well task. give task, can just laser task. people
kind fight internal battle, convince
important interesting. kind incentivize internally.
people doesn't matter, bored tears information, can
just are, "Very disciplined people." tend admire people
see little bit later, not clear best way run attentional
system. might something business heightened levels
attention things

00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine

interested excited by. drill issue people ADHD
actually can focus intensely things enjoy curious about. Now,
enjoyment curiosity psychological terms, not even really psychological
terms. just way describe human experience liking things,
wanting know them. neuro-biological perspective,
clear identity signature dopamine. Dopamine released
neurons, call neuromodulator neuromodulator changes
activity circuits brain, certain circuits active others
particular, dopamine creates heightened state focus. tends contract
visual world tends make us pay attention things outside beyond
confines skin. call exteroception. Dopamine also tends put
us state motivation wanting things outside confines skin.
whether not pursuing something physical world, whether not
pursuing information outside world, dopamine largely responsible ability


drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine
acting like conductor. Dopamine saying circuit active circuit
active. default mode network default mode
network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

00:32:57 Low Dopamine ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse

conductor good conducting. Now can gain insight
system works fails treat looking current previous
treatments ADHD, well recreational drugs people ADHD
tend pursue like now certainly not proponent people ADHD taking
drugs recreationally, not about, look drug seeking
behavior couple drug seeking behavior desire remedy
attention deficit, start gaining really interesting insight dopamine
regulating circuits normal circumstances people ADHD.
exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused
alert people narcolepsy tend fall asleep, tend become called
cataplectic. tend just sort go limp muscles. invasion sleep

something wake up, make alert, focused motivated
good treatment narcolepsy. Adderall also used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form

really terrific thing. drug effect making alert

wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names

serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality

two free pillows. talk ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
also talk focus attention everybody's ability focus attend not
just people ADHD. also going talk tools allow anyone,
whether not ADHD not enhance level concentration focus.
Now, ADHD used called ADD Attention Deficit Disorder. record ADD


medical literature dating back early 1904. Now nothing special
1904. just first time showed standard medical literature.
believe ADD, now call ADHD existed 1904 probably
long 1904, why? Well, strong genetic component.
close relative ADHD, much higher probability will ADHD
probability goes depending closely related person
happen be. instance, identical twin twin ADHD,
high concordance say, high probability will ADHD
75% chance. fraternal twin ADHD, number goes bit
50 60% range on. parent ADHD, number ranges
anywhere 10 25% likelihood, will ADHD two parents
on, okay? genetic component genetic component
turns out, relates directly specific neural circuits brain wire up,
chemicals use way use chemicals, topic going
discuss depth today. Now, close relative ADHD, not mean
faded ADHD happen ADHD, ways
overcome symptoms lack attention, impulsivity on. Another important
point ADHD nothing intelligence, whether not
talking intelligence measured standard IQ test rather controversial issue
many probably know, lots forms intelligence standard IQ test
just wouldn't pick emotional intelligence, musical intelligence, spatial intelligence,
sorts intelligences. None related ADHD. high functioning
doesn't make likely ADHD ADHD doesn't necessarily mean
low IQ. people ADHD low IQs people
ADHD high IQ, people ADHD high emotional IQ low IQ
emotional scale, place. important point ability attend
focus not relate smart IQ type, not just
standard IQ. renaming ADD ADHD took place mid late 1980s
psychiatric community psychological community started taking better
notice fact so-called hyperactive kids also attentional issues. might
seem obvious, extensive ongoing revision criteria
designating psychiatric disorder still ongoing process even today.
mid eighties, started hearing ADHD gradually term ADD
dropped away. However, just renaming ADD ADHD led much


better diagnosis detection ADHD. right now current estimates
one 10 children probably ADHD. current estimates
anywhere 10%, one 10 high 12%. Now, fortunately half
will resolve proper treatment, half typically don't. thing
seeing lot nowadays increased levels ADHD adults
question whether not adults ADHD went undetected
childhood whether not ADHD now cropping adulthood due way
interacting world particular smart phone use, combination email,
text, real-world interactions, multiple apps streams media social media
coming trying manage life. things going creating
kind cloud poles attention question whether not
creating ADHD adults never ADHD

00:13:00 Attention & Focus, Impulse Control

prior adult. talk attention first just define
mean attention scientific literature discussions ADHD,
will hear things like attention focus concentration impulse control
sake today's discussion, attention, focus, concentration essentially
thing, okay? split hairs scientific literature split hairs these.
want understand biology want straightforward
conversation ADHD, say attention focus, basically referring
thing, unless specify otherwise, okay? people ADHD trouble holding
attention. attention? Well, attention perception. perceiving
sensory world. just little bit neurobiology 101, sensing things time.
information coming nervous system time. instance, right now
hearing sound waves. seeing things, sensing things
skin, paying attention ones paying
attention perceptions. hear voice, perceiving voice.
not paying attention senses moment, okay? might even
outside breeze said that, might not perceiving breeze,
body sensing along. attention focus less
thing, impulse control something separate impulse control requires
pushing putting blinders sensory events environment. means


lack perception, impulse control limiting perception. People ADHD
poor attention high levels impulsivity

00:14:57 Hyper-focus

easily distractable. way shows surprising. might think
people ADHD just simply can't attend anything. really can't focus, even
really want to, simply not case. People ADHD yes,
distractable. Yes, impulsive. Yes, easily annoyed things happening
room. sometimes high level emotionality well. Not always,
often however people ADHD can hyper focus incredible ability focus
things really enjoy intrigued by. Now, important
point typically think somebody ADHD really wild
hyperactive, no ability whatsoever sit still attend
phenotype call contour behavior cognition can exist, many people,
not people ADHD, give something really love, like child
loves video games child loves draw, adult loves particular type
movie person much, will obtain laser-focus without effort. tells
us people ADHD capacity attend, can't engage
attention things don't really, really want know much
life, whether not child adult involves lot things don't
want do, much schooling involves things prefer not
sort forcing it, attend, even though not super interested
attending to.

00:16:45 Time Perception

couple things people ADHD display quite often. One
challenges time perception. Now time perception fascinating aspect
brain works later going talk time perception can actually
get better time perception. likely right now things get
way optimal time perception will tell adjust ability
measure time brain. People ADHD often run late. often
procrastinate, interesting surprising given deadline,


actually can perceive time well often can focus well
consequences not completing task not attending severe enough. little bit
like way people ADHD can really focus like something. Well,
scared enough consequences not attending, oftentimes not always,
oftentimes can attend. not really concerned deadline
consequence, well, tend lose track time tend underestimate
long things will take. Now many people that, not just people ADHD,
people ADHD challenges, understanding line activities
day order meet particular deadlines even just simple thing, like finishing one
set tasks lunch, oftentimes will remember lunch starts noon,
somehow aren't able fill intervening time way productive
can obsess

00:18:25 Pile System

upcoming deadline instance, will talk remedy this. addition,
spatial organization skills often subpar, not always, often will find
somebody ADHD uses called pile system order organize things,
will take many belongings kitchen bedroom
office space will start piling things according
categorization system makes sense them. doesn't really
logical framework. Now, many people use pile system use pile
system, doesn't mean ADHD fact, unpacking house
moved recently, received lot presence recently, pile system
makes perfect sense organize space. people ADHD tend organize
things according pile system time pile system doesn't work
them. Okay, key distinction use filing system, not really
files, piling things way makes sense them, doesn't work
terms tasks actually need perform. can't find things
anyone moves one thing disruptive overall plan
overall plan doesn't really work first place. common phenotype
call it. phenotype way, just expression particular set underlying
genetic psychological components, okay? say phenotype. phenotype
can brown hair green eyes, like me,



00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
people pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, probably
remember minute now without writing down. add one
number 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, gets tougher, okay? reason phone
numbers typically seven digits them, course, area code,
remembering information strings longer seven numbers sentence
two challenging people, people ADHD severe challenges, even
much smaller batches information even much smaller batches time.
Deficits working memory also something see people
frontotemporal dementia, damage frontal lobes age-related cognitive decline
will come no surprise later discuss treatments, supplements,
tools ADHD, many treatments, supplements tools
ADHD similar ones work age-related cognitive decline. Okay,
less established kind menu items people ADHD tend
them. just subset them. severity can range
intense mild, general, challenges attention focus, challenges
impulse control, get annoyed easily. kind impulsivity,


can't stay task. Time perception can off, use piling system system
doesn't work well order organize things physical space
hard time anything mundane not really interested in.
again, just want highlight people ADHD able obtain heightened
levels focus, even hyper-focus things exciting really
want engage in. now contour ADHD is,
somebody doesn't ADHD, also asking aspects
ADHD similar things experienced before. know
healthy brain also range abilities focus. people focus
well task. give task, can just laser task. people
kind fight internal battle, convince
important interesting. kind incentivize internally.
people doesn't matter, bored tears information, can
just are, "Very disciplined people." tend admire people
see little bit later, not clear best way run attentional
system. might something business heightened levels
attention things

00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine

interested excited by. drill issue people ADHD
actually can focus intensely things enjoy curious about. Now,
enjoyment curiosity psychological terms, not even really psychological
terms. just way describe human experience liking things,
wanting know them. neuro-biological perspective,
clear identity signature dopamine. Dopamine released
neurons, call neuromodulator neuromodulator changes
activity circuits brain, certain circuits active others
particular, dopamine creates heightened state focus. tends contract
visual world tends make us pay attention things outside beyond
confines skin. call exteroception. Dopamine also tends put
us state motivation wanting things outside confines skin.
whether not pursuing something physical world, whether not
pursuing information outside world, dopamine largely responsible ability


drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine
acting like conductor. Dopamine saying circuit active circuit
active. default mode network default mode
network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

00:32:57 Low Dopamine ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse

conductor good conducting. Now can gain insight
system works fails treat looking current previous
treatments ADHD, well recreational drugs people ADHD
tend pursue like now certainly not proponent people ADHD taking
drugs recreationally, not about, look drug seeking
behavior couple drug seeking behavior desire remedy
attention deficit, start gaining really interesting insight dopamine
regulating circuits normal circumstances people ADHD.
exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused
alert people narcolepsy tend fall asleep, tend become called
cataplectic. tend just sort go limp muscles. invasion sleep
daytime. dysregulated emotion. can imagine stimulant,
something wake up, make alert, focused motivated
good treatment narcolepsy. Adderall also used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without
going lot tangential detail. know, different times day, tend
less alert. long sustained release drug might sound like
really terrific thing. drug effect making alert
released across many hours day, might periods day
feel alert, periods day, feel just right periods day,


wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much

01:51:45 Modafinil & Armodafanil: Dopamine Action & Orexin

attention ADHD definitely take vasodilation vasoconstriction headache issue
consideration. like talk drug Modafinil closely related drug
armodafinil AR Modafinil. Modafinil armodafinil gaining popularity
there, treatment ADHD narcolepsy, also communities
people trying stay awake long periods time. actively used
military first responders, gaining popularity college campuses people
using alternative Adderall Ritalin excessive amounts

expensive, don't know still expensive, one prescription it,
still cost much eight $900 even $1000 month. Armodafinil far less
expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,
lead increases dopamine. So, whereas Ritalin Adderall,
amphetamine, cocaine lead big increases dopamine also re-uptake
mechanisms forth Modafinil weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator

involved generating muscular contractions kinds movements.
Acetylcholine also released two sites brain. little bit nomenclature

00:13:00 Attention & Focus, Impulse Control

prior adult. talk attention first just define
mean attention scientific literature discussions ADHD,
will hear things like attention focus concentration impulse control
sake today's discussion, attention, focus, concentration essentially
thing, okay? split hairs scientific literature split hairs these.
want understand biology want straightforward
conversation ADHD, say attention focus, basically referring
thing, unless specify otherwise, okay? people ADHD trouble holding
attention. attention? Well, attention perception. perceiving
sensory world. just little bit neurobiology 101, sensing things time.
information coming nervous system time. instance, right now
hearing sound waves. seeing things, sensing things
skin, paying attention ones paying
attention perceptions. hear voice, perceiving voice.
not paying attention senses moment, okay? might even
outside breeze said that, might not perceiving breeze,
body sensing along. attention focus less
thing, impulse control something separate impulse control requires
pushing putting blinders sensory events environment. means


lack perception, impulse control limiting perception. People ADHD
poor attention high levels impulsivity

00:14:57 Hyper-focus

easily distractable. way shows surprising. might think
people ADHD just simply can't attend anything. really can't focus, even
really want to, simply not case. People ADHD yes,
distractable. Yes, impulsive. Yes, easily annoyed things happening
room. sometimes high level emotionality well. Not always,
often however people ADHD can hyper focus incredible ability focus
things really enjoy intrigued by. Now, important
point typically think somebody ADHD really wild
hyperactive, no ability whatsoever sit still attend
phenotype call contour behavior cognition can exist, many people,
not people ADHD, give something really love, like child
loves video games child loves draw, adult loves particular type
movie person much, will obtain laser-focus without effort. tells
us people ADHD capacity attend, can't engage
attention things don't really, really want know much
life, whether not child adult involves lot things don't
want do, much schooling involves things prefer not
sort forcing it, attend, even though not super interested
attending to.

00:16:45 Time Perception

couple things people ADHD display quite often. One
challenges time perception. Now time perception fascinating aspect
brain works later going talk time perception can actually
get better time perception. likely right now things get
way optimal time perception will tell adjust ability
measure time brain. People ADHD often run late. often
procrastinate, interesting surprising given deadline,


actually can perceive time well often can focus well
consequences not completing task not attending severe enough. little bit
like way people ADHD can really focus like something. Well,
scared enough consequences not attending, oftentimes not always,
oftentimes can attend. not really concerned deadline
consequence, well, tend lose track time tend underestimate
long things will take. Now many people that, not just people ADHD,
people ADHD challenges, understanding line activities
day order meet particular deadlines even just simple thing, like finishing one
set tasks lunch, oftentimes will remember lunch starts noon,
somehow aren't able fill intervening time way productive
can obsess

00:18:25 Pile System

upcoming deadline instance, will talk remedy this. addition,
spatial organization skills often subpar, not always, often will find
somebody ADHD uses called pile system order organize things,
will take many belongings kitchen bedroom
office space will start piling things according
categorization system makes sense them. doesn't really
logical framework. Now, many people use pile system use pile
system, doesn't mean ADHD fact, unpacking house
moved recently, received lot presence recently, pile system
makes perfect sense organize space. people ADHD tend organize
things according pile system time pile system doesn't work
them. Okay, key distinction use filing system, not really
files, piling things way makes sense them, doesn't work
terms tasks actually need perform. can't find things
anyone moves one thing disruptive overall plan
overall plan doesn't really work first place. common phenotype
call it. phenotype way, just expression particular set underlying
genetic psychological components, okay? say phenotype. phenotype
can brown hair green eyes, like me,



00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
people pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, probably
remember minute now without writing down. add one
number 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, gets tougher, okay? reason phone
numbers typically seven digits them, course, area code,
remembering information strings longer seven numbers sentence
two challenging people, people ADHD severe challenges, even
much smaller batches information even much smaller batches time.
Deficits working memory also something see people
frontotemporal dementia, damage frontal lobes age-related cognitive decline
will come no surprise later discuss treatments, supplements,
tools ADHD, many treatments, supplements tools
ADHD similar ones work age-related cognitive decline. Okay,
less established kind menu items people ADHD tend
them. just subset them. severity can range
intense mild, general, challenges attention focus, challenges
impulse control, get annoyed easily. kind impulsivity,


can't stay task. Time perception can off, use piling system system
doesn't work well order organize things physical space
hard time anything mundane not really interested in.
again, just want highlight people ADHD able obtain heightened
levels focus, even hyper-focus things exciting really
want engage in. now contour ADHD is,
somebody doesn't ADHD, also asking aspects
ADHD similar things experienced before. know
healthy brain also range abilities focus. people focus
well task. give task, can just laser task. people
kind fight internal battle, convince
important interesting. kind incentivize internally.
people doesn't matter, bored tears information, can
just are, "Very disciplined people." tend admire people
see little bit later, not clear best way run attentional
system. might something business heightened levels
attention things

00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine

interested excited by. drill issue people ADHD
actually can focus intensely things enjoy curious about. Now,
enjoyment curiosity psychological terms, not even really psychological
terms. just way describe human experience liking things,
wanting know them. neuro-biological perspective,
clear identity signature dopamine. Dopamine released
neurons, call neuromodulator neuromodulator changes
activity circuits brain, certain circuits active others
particular, dopamine creates heightened state focus. tends contract
visual world tends make us pay attention things outside beyond
confines skin. call exteroception. Dopamine also tends put
us state motivation wanting things outside confines skin.
whether not pursuing something physical world, whether not
pursuing information outside world, dopamine largely responsible ability


drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat

dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need

problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people

likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind

just illustrate it. friend, two children now

dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults

look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine

drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good

drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical

will hear things like attention focus concentration impulse control
sake today's discussion, attention, focus, concentration essentially
thing, okay? split hairs scientific literature split hairs these.
want understand biology want straightforward
conversation ADHD, say attention focus, basically referring
thing, unless specify otherwise, okay? people ADHD trouble holding
attention. attention? Well, attention perception. perceiving
sensory world. just little bit neurobiology 101, sensing things time.
information coming nervous system time. instance, right now
hearing sound waves. seeing things, sensing things
skin, paying attention ones paying

lack perception, impulse control limiting perception. People ADHD
poor attention high levels impulsivity

00:14:57 Hyper-focus

easily distractable. way shows surprising. might think
people ADHD just simply can't attend anything. really can't focus, even
really want to, simply not case. People ADHD yes,
distractable. Yes, impulsive. Yes, easily annoyed things happening
room. sometimes high level emotionality well. Not always,
often however people ADHD can hyper focus incredible ability focus
things really enjoy intrigued by. Now, important
point typically think somebody ADHD really wild
hyperactive, no ability whatsoever sit still attend
phenotype call contour behavior cognition can exist, many people,
not people ADHD, give something really love, like child

attending to.

00:16:45 Time Perception

couple things people ADHD display quite often. One
challenges time perception. Now time perception fascinating aspect
brain works later going talk time perception can actually
get better time perception. likely right now things get
way optimal time perception will tell adjust ability
measure time brain. People ADHD often run late. often
procrastinate, interesting surprising given deadline,


actually can perceive time well often can focus well
consequences not completing task not attending severe enough. little bit
like way people ADHD can really focus like something. Well,
scared enough consequences not attending, oftentimes not always,
oftentimes can attend. not really concerned deadline
consequence, well, tend lose track time tend underestimate
long things will take. Now many people that, not just people ADHD,
people ADHD challenges, understanding line activities
day order meet particular deadlines even just simple thing, like finishing one
set tasks lunch, oftentimes will remember lunch starts noon,
somehow aren't able fill intervening time way productive
can obsess

00:18:25 Pile System

upcoming deadline instance, will talk remedy this. addition,
spatial organization skills often subpar, not always, often will find
somebody ADHD uses called pile system order organize things,
will take many belongings kitchen bedroom
office space will start piling things according
categorization system makes sense them. doesn't really
logical framework. Now, many people use pile system use pile
system, doesn't mean ADHD fact, unpacking house
moved recently, received lot presence recently, pile system
makes perfect sense organize space. people ADHD tend organize
things according pile system time pile system doesn't work
them. Okay, key distinction use filing system, not really
files, piling things way makes sense them, doesn't work
terms tasks actually need perform. can't find things
anyone moves one thing disruptive overall plan
overall plan doesn't really work first place. common phenotype
call it. phenotype way, just expression particular set underlying
genetic psychological components, okay? say phenotype. phenotype
can brown hair green eyes, like me,



00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1

neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part

know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency

dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people

likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind

just illustrate it. friend, two children now

look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil

basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good

lack perception, impulse control limiting perception. People ADHD
poor attention high levels impulsivity

00:14:57 Hyper-focus

easily distractable. way shows surprising. might think
people ADHD just simply can't attend anything. really can't focus, even
really want to, simply not case. People ADHD yes,
distractable. Yes, impulsive. Yes, easily annoyed things happening
room. sometimes high level emotionality well. Not always,
often however people ADHD can hyper focus incredible ability focus
things really enjoy intrigued by. Now, important
point typically think somebody ADHD really wild
hyperactive, no ability whatsoever sit still attend
phenotype call contour behavior cognition can exist, many people,
not people ADHD, give something really love, like child
loves video games child loves draw, adult loves particular type
movie person much, will obtain laser-focus without effort. tells
us people ADHD capacity attend, can't engage
attention things don't really, really want know much
life, whether not child adult involves lot things don't
want do, much schooling involves things prefer not
sort forcing it, attend, even though not super interested
attending to.

00:16:45 Time Perception

couple things people ADHD display quite often. One
challenges time perception. Now time perception fascinating aspect
brain works later going talk time perception can actually
get better time perception. likely right now things get
way optimal time perception will tell adjust ability
measure time brain. People ADHD often run late. often
procrastinate, interesting surprising given deadline,


actually can perceive time well often can focus well
consequences not completing task not attending severe enough. little bit
like way people ADHD can really focus like something. Well,
scared enough consequences not attending, oftentimes not always,
oftentimes can attend. not really concerned deadline
consequence, well, tend lose track time tend underestimate
long things will take. Now many people that, not just people ADHD,
people ADHD challenges, understanding line activities
day order meet particular deadlines even just simple thing, like finishing one
set tasks lunch, oftentimes will remember lunch starts noon,
somehow aren't able fill intervening time way productive
can obsess

00:18:25 Pile System

upcoming deadline instance, will talk remedy this. addition,
spatial organization skills often subpar, not always, often will find
somebody ADHD uses called pile system order organize things,
will take many belongings kitchen bedroom
office space will start piling things according
categorization system makes sense them. doesn't really
logical framework. Now, many people use pile system use pile
system, doesn't mean ADHD fact, unpacking house
moved recently, received lot presence recently, pile system
makes perfect sense organize space. people ADHD tend organize
things according pile system time pile system doesn't work
them. Okay, key distinction use filing system, not really
files, piling things way makes sense them, doesn't work
terms tasks actually need perform. can't find things
anyone moves one thing disruptive overall plan
overall plan doesn't really work first place. common phenotype
call it. phenotype way, just expression particular set underlying
genetic psychological components, okay? say phenotype. phenotype
can brown hair green eyes, like me,



00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
people pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, probably
remember minute now without writing down. add one
number 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, gets tougher, okay? reason phone
numbers typically seven digits them, course, area code,
remembering information strings longer seven numbers sentence
two challenging people, people ADHD severe challenges, even
much smaller batches information even much smaller batches time.
Deficits working memory also something see people
frontotemporal dementia, damage frontal lobes age-related cognitive decline
will come no surprise later discuss treatments, supplements,
tools ADHD, many treatments, supplements tools
ADHD similar ones work age-related cognitive decline. Okay,
less established kind menu items people ADHD tend
them. just subset them. severity can range
intense mild, general, challenges attention focus, challenges
impulse control, get annoyed easily. kind impulsivity,


can't stay task. Time perception can off, use piling system system
doesn't work well order organize things physical space
hard time anything mundane not really interested in.
again, just want highlight people ADHD able obtain heightened
levels focus, even hyper-focus things exciting really
want engage in. now contour ADHD is,
somebody doesn't ADHD, also asking aspects
ADHD similar things experienced before. know
healthy brain also range abilities focus. people focus
well task. give task, can just laser task. people
kind fight internal battle, convince
important interesting. kind incentivize internally.
people doesn't matter, bored tears information, can
just are, "Very disciplined people." tend admire people
see little bit later, not clear best way run attentional
system. might something business heightened levels
attention things

00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine

interested excited by. drill issue people ADHD
actually can focus intensely things enjoy curious about. Now,
enjoyment curiosity psychological terms, not even really psychological
terms. just way describe human experience liking things,
wanting know them. neuro-biological perspective,
clear identity signature dopamine. Dopamine released
neurons, call neuromodulator neuromodulator changes
activity circuits brain, certain circuits active others
particular, dopamine creates heightened state focus. tends contract
visual world tends make us pay attention things outside beyond
confines skin. call exteroception. Dopamine also tends put
us state motivation wanting things outside confines skin.
whether not pursuing something physical world, whether not
pursuing information outside world, dopamine largely responsible ability


drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine

conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed

exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long

ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.

dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine

Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various

basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good

actually can perceive time well often can focus well
consequences not completing task not attending severe enough. little bit
like way people ADHD can really focus like something. Well,
scared enough consequences not attending, oftentimes not always,
oftentimes can attend. not really concerned deadline
consequence, well, tend lose track time tend underestimate
long things will take. Now many people that, not just people ADHD,
people ADHD challenges, understanding line activities
day order meet particular deadlines even just simple thing, like finishing one
set tasks lunch, oftentimes will remember lunch starts noon,
somehow aren't able fill intervening time way productive
can obsess

00:18:25 Pile System

upcoming deadline instance, will talk remedy this. addition,
spatial organization skills often subpar, not always, often will find
somebody ADHD uses called pile system order organize things,
will take many belongings kitchen bedroom
office space will start piling things according
categorization system makes sense them. doesn't really
logical framework. Now, many people use pile system use pile
system, doesn't mean ADHD fact, unpacking house
moved recently, received lot presence recently, pile system
makes perfect sense organize space. people ADHD tend organize
things according pile system time pile system doesn't work
them. Okay, key distinction use filing system, not really
files, piling things way makes sense them, doesn't work
terms tasks actually need perform. can't find things
anyone moves one thing disruptive overall plan
overall plan doesn't really work first place. common phenotype
call it. phenotype way, just expression particular set underlying
genetic psychological components, okay? say phenotype. phenotype
can brown hair green eyes, like me,



00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
people pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, probably
remember minute now without writing down. add one
number 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, gets tougher, okay? reason phone
numbers typically seven digits them, course, area code,
remembering information strings longer seven numbers sentence
two challenging people, people ADHD severe challenges, even
much smaller batches information even much smaller batches time.
Deficits working memory also something see people
frontotemporal dementia, damage frontal lobes age-related cognitive decline
will come no surprise later discuss treatments, supplements,
tools ADHD, many treatments, supplements tools
ADHD similar ones work age-related cognitive decline. Okay,
less established kind menu items people ADHD tend
them. just subset them. severity can range
intense mild, general, challenges attention focus, challenges
impulse control, get annoyed easily. kind impulsivity,


can't stay task. Time perception can off, use piling system system
doesn't work well order organize things physical space
hard time anything mundane not really interested in.
again, just want highlight people ADHD able obtain heightened
levels focus, even hyper-focus things exciting really
want engage in. now contour ADHD is,
somebody doesn't ADHD, also asking aspects
ADHD similar things experienced before. know
healthy brain also range abilities focus. people focus
well task. give task, can just laser task. people
kind fight internal battle, convince
important interesting. kind incentivize internally.
people doesn't matter, bored tears information, can
just are, "Very disciplined people." tend admire people
see little bit later, not clear best way run attentional
system. might something business heightened levels
attention things

00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine

interested excited by. drill issue people ADHD
actually can focus intensely things enjoy curious about. Now,
enjoyment curiosity psychological terms, not even really psychological
terms. just way describe human experience liking things,
wanting know them. neuro-biological perspective,
clear identity signature dopamine. Dopamine released
neurons, call neuromodulator neuromodulator changes
activity circuits brain, certain circuits active others
particular, dopamine creates heightened state focus. tends contract
visual world tends make us pay attention things outside beyond
confines skin. call exteroception. Dopamine also tends put
us state motivation wanting things outside confines skin.
whether not pursuing something physical world, whether not
pursuing information outside world, dopamine largely responsible ability


drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine
acting like conductor. Dopamine saying circuit active circuit
active. default mode network default mode
network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

00:32:57 Low Dopamine ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse

conductor good conducting. Now can gain insight
system works fails treat looking current previous
treatments ADHD, well recreational drugs people ADHD
tend pursue like now certainly not proponent people ADHD taking
drugs recreationally, not about, look drug seeking
behavior couple drug seeking behavior desire remedy
attention deficit, start gaining really interesting insight dopamine
regulating circuits normal circumstances people ADHD.
exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused
alert people narcolepsy tend fall asleep, tend become called
cataplectic. tend just sort go limp muscles. invasion sleep

something wake up, make alert, focused motivated

can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine

typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called

brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names

00:20:00 Working Memory

phenotype also somebody uses piling system, okay? thing
people ADHD real trouble so-called working memory. Now
might think people ADHD really poor memories, fact,
not case. People ADHD often can terrific memory past events,
can remember upcoming events quite well. memory clearly working. However,
one aspect memory particular call working memory often disrupted.
Working memory ability keep specific information online, recycle
brain again, can use immediate short term. good
example meet somebody, tell name, give
phone number verbally, walk back phone enter
phone. People without ADHD might put effort it, might feel like
bit struggle, typically will able recite phone number mind
over, put phone. People ADHD, tend lose ability
lack ability remember things just need keep online anywhere
10 seconds minute two, okay? string numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
people pretty easy. 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, probably
remember minute now without writing down. add one
number 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3, gets tougher, okay? reason phone
numbers typically seven digits them, course, area code,
remembering information strings longer seven numbers sentence
two challenging people, people ADHD severe challenges, even
much smaller batches information even much smaller batches time.
Deficits working memory also something see people
frontotemporal dementia, damage frontal lobes age-related cognitive decline
will come no surprise later discuss treatments, supplements,
tools ADHD, many treatments, supplements tools
ADHD similar ones work age-related cognitive decline. Okay,
less established kind menu items people ADHD tend
them. just subset them. severity can range
intense mild, general, challenges attention focus, challenges
impulse control, get annoyed easily. kind impulsivity,


can't stay task. Time perception can off, use piling system system
doesn't work well order organize things physical space
hard time anything mundane not really interested in.
again, just want highlight people ADHD able obtain heightened
levels focus, even hyper-focus things exciting really
want engage in. now contour ADHD is,
somebody doesn't ADHD, also asking aspects
ADHD similar things experienced before. know
healthy brain also range abilities focus. people focus
well task. give task, can just laser task. people
kind fight internal battle, convince
important interesting. kind incentivize internally.
people doesn't matter, bored tears information, can
just are, "Very disciplined people." tend admire people
see little bit later, not clear best way run attentional
system. might something business heightened levels
attention things

00:24:10 Hyper-Focus & Dopamine

interested excited by. drill issue people ADHD
actually can focus intensely things enjoy curious about. Now,
enjoyment curiosity psychological terms, not even really psychological
terms. just way describe human experience liking things,
wanting know them. neuro-biological perspective,
clear identity signature dopamine. Dopamine released
neurons, call neuromodulator neuromodulator changes
activity circuits brain, certain circuits active others
particular, dopamine creates heightened state focus. tends contract
visual world tends make us pay attention things outside beyond
confines skin. call exteroception. Dopamine also tends put
us state motivation wanting things outside confines skin.
whether not pursuing something physical world, whether not
pursuing information outside world, dopamine largely responsible ability


drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine
acting like conductor. Dopamine saying circuit active circuit
active. default mode network default mode
network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

00:32:57 Low Dopamine ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse

conductor good conducting. Now can gain insight
system works fails treat looking current previous
treatments ADHD, well recreational drugs people ADHD
tend pursue like now certainly not proponent people ADHD taking
drugs recreationally, not about, look drug seeking
behavior couple drug seeking behavior desire remedy
attention deficit, start gaining really interesting insight dopamine
regulating circuits normal circumstances people ADHD.
exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused
alert people narcolepsy tend fall asleep, tend become called
cataplectic. tend just sort go limp muscles. invasion sleep

something wake up, make alert, focused motivated
good treatment narcolepsy. Adderall also used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without

really terrific thing. drug effect making alert

feel alert, periods day, feel just right periods day,


wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much
serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality

Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see

moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine

network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

00:32:57 Low Dopamine ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse

conductor good conducting. Now can gain insight

exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused
alert people narcolepsy tend fall asleep, tend become called
cataplectic. tend just sort go limp muscles. invasion sleep

something wake up, make alert, focused motivated
good treatment narcolepsy. Adderall also used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without
going lot tangential detail. know, different times day, tend
less alert. long sustained release drug might sound like
really terrific thing. drug effect making alert
released across many hours day, might periods day
feel alert, periods day, feel just right periods day,


wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much
serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality

drive that. dopamine neuromodulator also involved changing
way perceive world. So, mentioned earlier senses
coming can perceive paying attention
them. Dopamine released brain tends turn areas
brain narrow visual focus auditory focus, creates cone auditory
attention, narrow, creates tunnel visual attention narrow.
Whereas less dopamine, tend view entire world, tend see
whole scene in, tend hear everything once. describe
this, hopefully already starting see understand dopamine
release can allow person, whether not ADHD not direct
attention particular things environment, right? now
moving away attention kind vague ambiguous term,
giving neurochemical identity dopamine,

00:26:40 Neural Circuits ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks

giving neural circuit identity just put little bit flavor detail
neurocircuits are, want discuss two general types neurocircuits
dopamine tends enhance. talk neurocircuits love
hearing neuroscience, nomenclature, going eat part
don't like lot names brain areas invite tune just try grab
top contour this. will describe pretty general terms, will give detail
know really want dig deeper
exact structures connectivities are, okay? two main types circuits
need think respect ADHD, attention dopamine. first one
called default mode network. default mode network network brain
areas brain brain everybody's brain active not
anything just sitting idle rest. Now hard not think
anything, not engaged type specific task, not
driving, not playing video game, not trying study, not trying
listen, just sitting letting brain kind go wherever wants go.
default mode network underlies state mind. set circuits
going think talk respect ADHD task networks,
networks brain make goal oriented, least trying make


goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine
acting like conductor. Dopamine saying circuit active circuit
active. default mode network default mode
network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

00:32:57 Low Dopamine ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse

conductor good conducting. Now can gain insight
system works fails treat looking current previous
treatments ADHD, well recreational drugs people ADHD
tend pursue like now certainly not proponent people ADHD taking
drugs recreationally, not about, look drug seeking
behavior couple drug seeking behavior desire remedy
attention deficit, start gaining really interesting insight dopamine
regulating circuits normal circumstances people ADHD.
exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused
alert people narcolepsy tend fall asleep, tend become called
cataplectic. tend just sort go limp muscles. invasion sleep
daytime. dysregulated emotion. can imagine stimulant,
something wake up, make alert, focused motivated
good treatment narcolepsy. Adderall also used treat ADHD treat
narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without
going lot tangential detail. know, different times day, tend
less alert. long sustained release drug might sound like
really terrific thing. drug effect making alert
released across many hours day, might periods day
feel alert, periods day, feel just right periods day,


wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much
serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality
psychiatrist neurologist family physician board certified MD
prescribes things, many people ADHD achieve excellent relief
drugs, not them, many do, especially treatments started
early life. now knowing drugs are, want raise question
prescribe drugs? mean, everyone make decision
child whether not going take things not. also want


acknowledge many people there, many, many people taking

00:47:00 Non-Prescribed Adderall, Caffeine, Nicotine

sort blew right past it. fact upwards 25% young people taking

ridiculously high number. years ago, estimated Adderall use Ritalin

now consumption Adderall without prescription higher consumption
cannabis age group. means lot stimulant use

gain focus. can whole discussion whether not life becoming

that. frankly, interesting discussion, not one

people always self-medicating increase, focus, right? Caffeine, can
indulge some, don't think access long used stimulant increase
dopamine, increase norepinephrine, increased focus energy addition that,

coffee gives energy makes feel good increases focus

goal oriented completely different set brain areas. However,
default mode network tasks networks communicating one another
interesting ways. first want describe two
sets brain areas, default mode network task networks normally interact,
okay? little bit naming feel free ignore don't want level
detail, default mode network includes area called dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontal cortex, no surprises front dorsal, top side
lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. got one side brain, right?
brain area called posterior cingulate cortex
area called lateral parietal lobe. Again, don't need remember names
for, three brain areas normally synchronized activity.
one areas active typical person, areas active well.
little bit like symphony band like three-piece band like drums, guitar,
bass playing together, okay? typical person
person ADHD, even person subclinical ADHD human
hasn't slept well, find default mode network not synchronized.
brain areas just not playing well together. Now task networks include
different set structures. still involves prefrontal cortex, different part
prefrontal cortex, okay? Tends medial prefrontal cortex
brain areas medial prefrontal cortex communicating time,
mainly suppress impulses. shutting desire stand scratch
side cheek nose, trying not that, anytime restricting
behavior, task directed networks active, okay? Now normally
person without ADHD, task networks default mode networks going
kind Seesaw fashion, actually call anti-correlated. not just
not correlated, actually opposing one another anti-correlated.
person ADHD, default mode networks tasks networks actually
coordinated. might come surprising, think tendency
kind jump conclusion assume somebody doesn't easy time
paying attention ADHD, brain must completely incoherent not
working well everything's whack, something interesting
people ADHD whereby task networks default mode networks
actually working together way correlated abnormal.
like guitar bass drums playing together way bass


isn't keeping backbeat drums, aren't keeping backbeat
playing together, playing melodies harmonies way just
doesn't sound right. going brain somebody ADHD
can now confidently say based brain imaging studies, somebody gets
better, treated ADHD age ADHD, sometimes
case default mode networks task networks tend become anti-
correlated again, okay? underlying neurobiology, notice
didn't mention dopamine all. dopamine context dopamine

network not active, task network. really acting
conductor saying, go, now go, now go, now go. ADHD,
something dopamine system not allowing conduct networks
make sure stay what, engineers physicists mathematicians
say phase anti-correlated, okay? phase anti correlate, essentially
thing, least purposes discussion. raises two questions,
dopamine not sufficiently high levels dopamine
just wrong? words, no conductor conductor playing
like little tiny toothpicks instruments can't see supposed
do. can't get instruction 'cause just not loud enough, speak,
information getting out, information getting wrong,
conductor's there,

attention deficit, start gaining really interesting insight dopamine

exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple
espressos, prominent smoking half pack cigarettes
drinking four cups coffee day person access using cocaine
recreational drug amphetamine recreational drug. substances
just described particular cocaine amphetamine, also coffee cigarettes
increase levels multiple neurotransmitters, quality increasing levels
dopamine brain particular, regions brain regulate
attention task related default mode networks okay? Now young children,
fortunately don't access kinds stimulants time
stimulants high potential abuse adults. will talk potential
abuse minutes. look children, even young children
ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes
excess poor levels attention couldn't make good
decisions, impulsive forth certainly
case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited
eat kind activity normally get somebody really aroused

narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without
going lot tangential detail. know, different times day, tend
less alert. long sustained release drug might sound like
really terrific thing. drug effect making alert

feel alert, periods day, feel just right periods day,


wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much
serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality

exactly going dopamine system, people ADHD going


dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple

ADHD, show things like preference sugary foods, also act dopamine


inducing stimulants. Now, course, get access soda pop

00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil

coffee tea, start indulge people. long
time, thought children ADHD consumed many sugary foods drank
much soda adults ADHD take recreational drugs like
methamphetamine cocaine drink coffee excess smoke cigarettes

case, knowing now know dopamine, fact enough
dopamine required order coordinate neural circuits allow focus
quality decision-making equally valid idea children adults
actually trying self-medicate pursuing compounds, right? Things like cocaine
lead huge increases dopamine. Well, happens somebody
ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.
like dark chocolate espresso beans really fault there, don't want
give kids dark chocolate espresso beans, really seeing
hyperactivity dopamine, okay? sugar combined caffeine
case, combined compounds exist chocolate, really increase
levels alertness tendency want move around lot, okay?
dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day

sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without
going lot tangential detail. know, different times day, tend
less alert. long sustained release drug might sound like
really terrific thing. drug effect making alert

feel alert, periods day, feel just right periods day,


wished alert. pharmacokinetics,
kinetics, meaning movement different compounds within bloodstream
brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much
serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality

dopamine system people terrific levels attention task?
Well, year 2015, important paper came out. first author Spencer,
came journal called Biological Psychiatry, formalized so-called low
dopamine hypothesis ADHD. idea dopamine somehow involved not
appropriate levels people ADHD around pretty long time,
formal proposition low dopamine hypothesis led really important
experiments understanding goes wrong ADHD. turns
dopamine levels low particular circuits brain, leads unnecessary
firing neurons brain unrelated task one trying
unrelated information one trying focus on. think back
got default mode network task-related network, need
kind concert anti-correlation ADHD firing together. Well,
problem seems dopamine low, certain neurons firing
shouldn't be, like band, right? go back band, guitar bass
it, person playing drums one several
instruments playing notes shouldn't playing, right? pauses
music just important actual playing notes. dopamine low
neurons fire, networks govern attention.
so-called low dopamine hypothesis start looking anecdotally people
ADHD done decades, not just recently since low dopamine hypothesis
proposed, 1950s 1940s
1960s. find tend use recreational drugs, tend indulge
non drug stimulants. things like drinking, six cups coffee quadruple

ADHD takes drug, turns actually obtain heightened levels focus,
ability focus things things absolutely care intensely goes up,
likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume
much sugar, tend become super hyperactive. consume kind
stimulant, tend go wild run around like crazy. Actually, anecdote
just illustrate it. friend, two children now
teens twenties, little, one time, brought chocolate
just gift, showed house within 30 minutes, kids
running around like crazy mean pretty high energy kids, going
bonkers actually mother, friend time, unfortunately, still
now looked chocolate, realized chocolate espresso beans it.

dopamine low levels dopamine apparently wrong people ADHD,


dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day

likewise, children consume anything increases levels dopamine,
children ADHD, tend calmer, tend able focus more. Now,
different children not ADHD. consume

dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults

look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine

someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel

drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar

dopamine hypothesis led idea treating people, children adults
included dopaminergic compounds somehow increase ability focus
look major drugs developed now marketed
pharmaceutical companies treatment ADHD, drugs names like
Ritalin. Nowadays, typically things like Adderall, Modafinil
derivatives, serve increase levels dopamine particular dopamine
networks control task directed behavior, coordinate default mode
network task-related networks. many probably heard
Ritalin. Ritalin prescription stimulant prescribed ADHD well
narcolepsy. Narcolepsy condition people tend fall asleep day
time, quite lot, excessive daytime sleepiness, not due lack sleep night, also
tend fall asleep get excited, really emotionally excited

narcolepsy things like Modafinil also used treat ADHD narcolepsy.
sensing theme here. differences similarities drugs
can tell us ADHD? Well, Ritalin one first-generation
drugs prescribed ADHD order deal head dopamine
hypothesis. idea ADHD, dopamine levels low. Nowadays, Adderall
typically prescribed drug ADHD so-called
pharmacokinetics, rate drugs enter system long last
system. instance, Ritalin drug packaged various time-
release formulas. Whereas initially Adderall released form
short life, meaning wasn't bloodstream long didn't affect
brain long dosages controlled typical way without

wished alert. pharmacokinetics,

brain could, imagine real way, impact whether not
someone feel really good one drugs whether not feel
anxious sleepy on. take step back second just ask,
drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good
number there, perhaps even parents kids don't realize
drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical
versions exactly used treat ADHD not exactly like
cocaine methamphetamine, structurally chemically similar
net effect brain body essentially same, increase
dopamine primarily, also increase levels neuromodulator called epinephrin
norepinephrine also called noradrenaline adrenaline names
extent increase levels serotonin brain blood, not much
serotonin, just kind small smidgen effect, okay? dopamine way
norepinephrine adrenaline way up. motivation drive, focus energy
extent, little bit serotonin, really feeling calm
relaxed can imagine good balancing effect dopamine
norepinephrine. essentially saying drugs used
treat ADHD stimulants, look much alike. fact, nearly identical
so-called street drugs, stimulants terrible. However,
want emphasize appropriate dosages working quality

takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking

dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember

drugs? know increase dopamine, really? Well,
Ritalin also called methylphenidate similar amphetamine speed,
typically call speed street drug nomenclature. Adderall, goes various
names, okay? Adderall, Adderall XR, dialysis, things like that. Adderall
basically combination amphetamine dextroamphetamine. Now
probably realize this, Adderall amphetamine, guessing good

drugs like cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine, incredibly dangerous
incredibly habit forming high potential abuse. Well, pharmaceutical

takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking

dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember

sort eyelids. Now, might come across somewhat obvious,
can fast, called spontaneous blinks always coordinated
two eyes can long blinks like go sleep night,

perception time starts drift go sleep. perception time

Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,

important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember

not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,

okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember

not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,

dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember

Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,
no basis, science blinking relates time perception
good data support it. want just emphasize one study particular, quite
appropriately titled, "Time dilates spontaneous blinking." paper
published current biology. first author Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. wonderful
paper. examine relationship fluctuations timing blinking
make long story short found right blinks, reset perception
time, okay? blinks sense little bit like curtain coming
scene scenes play takes movie, clap clap thing,
started take our, say, action end thing
click say, take one take blink take,
okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,
disorganized time. dopamine low, know well
underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.

01:22:50 Blinking, Dopamine & Time Perception; & Focus Training

makes seem like worthwhile thing everybody. just
talked attentional blinks, essentially blinks thinking mind

sort eyelids. Now, might come across somewhat obvious,
can fast, called spontaneous blinks always coordinated
two eyes can long blinks like go sleep night,
one long blink, not facetious. go sleep night,
shutting eyelids limiting amount information coming
perception time starts drift go sleep. perception time
changes fast, one moment slow meaning frame rate

slow. Time going rate, perception time changed.
Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,
no basis, science blinking relates time perception
good data support it. want just emphasize one study particular, quite
appropriately titled, "Time dilates spontaneous blinking." paper
published current biology. first author Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. wonderful
paper. examine relationship fluctuations timing blinking
make long story short found right blinks, reset perception
time, okay? blinks sense little bit like curtain coming
scene scenes play takes movie, clap clap thing,
started take our, say, action end thing
click say, take one take blink take,
okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,
disorganized time. dopamine low, know well
underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.

01:37:30 Interoceptive Awareness

basically saying marijuana seems increase people's focus,

expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,

Acetylcholine also released two sites brain. little bit nomenclature
again, feel free ignore nomenclature, collection neurons

talked attentional blinks, essentially blinks thinking mind
shutting off moment missing information. Now talk actual blinks,


sort eyelids. Now, might come across somewhat obvious,
can fast, called spontaneous blinks always coordinated
two eyes can long blinks like go sleep night,
one long blink, not facetious. go sleep night,
shutting eyelids limiting amount information coming
perception time starts drift go sleep. perception time
changes fast, one moment slow meaning frame rate

sometimes fast. Meaning experienced things slow motion. Sometimes
fast. waking experience time can sometimes fast sometimes

slow. Time going rate, perception time changed.
Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,
no basis, science blinking relates time perception
good data support it. want just emphasize one study particular, quite
appropriately titled, "Time dilates spontaneous blinking." paper
published current biology. first author Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. wonderful
paper. examine relationship fluctuations timing blinking
make long story short found right blinks, reset perception
time, okay? blinks sense little bit like curtain coming
scene scenes play takes movie, clap clap thing,
started take our, say, action end thing
click say, take one take blink take,
okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,
disorganized time. dopamine low, know well
underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.
makes perfect sense lose track time ability focus.

01:37:30 Interoceptive Awareness

basically saying marijuana seems increase people's focus,

expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,

talked attentional blinks, essentially blinks thinking mind

sort eyelids. Now, might come across somewhat obvious,
can fast, called spontaneous blinks always coordinated
two eyes can long blinks like go sleep night,
one long blink, not facetious. go sleep night,
shutting eyelids limiting amount information coming
perception time starts drift go sleep. perception time
changes fast, one moment slow meaning frame rate

slow. Time going rate, perception time changed.
Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,
no basis, science blinking relates time perception
good data support it. want just emphasize one study particular, quite
appropriately titled, "Time dilates spontaneous blinking." paper
published current biology. first author Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. wonderful
paper. examine relationship fluctuations timing blinking
make long story short found right blinks, reset perception
time, okay? blinks sense little bit like curtain coming
scene scenes play takes movie, clap clap thing,
started take our, say, action end thing
click say, take one take blink take,
okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,
disorganized time. dopamine low, know well
underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.
makes perfect sense lose track time ability focus.

01:22:50 Blinking, Dopamine & Time Perception; & Focus Training

makes seem like worthwhile thing everybody. just
talked attentional blinks, essentially blinks thinking mind
shutting off moment missing information. Now talk actual blinks,


sort eyelids. Now, might come across somewhat obvious,
can fast, called spontaneous blinks always coordinated
two eyes can long blinks like go sleep night,
one long blink, not facetious. go sleep night,
shutting eyelids limiting amount information coming
perception time starts drift go sleep. perception time
changes fast, one moment slow meaning frame rate

sometimes fast. Meaning experienced things slow motion. Sometimes
fast. waking experience time can sometimes fast sometimes
slow. Typically alert are, higher frame rate, thin slicing
experience. probably happen. ever stressed
waiting something somebody, seems like takes forever
frame rate higher analyzing time finely. Conversely,
relaxed even sleepy, wake think things
do. will seem like world going very, fast moving
slow. Time going rate, perception time changed.
Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,
no basis, science blinking relates time perception
good data support it. want just emphasize one study particular, quite
appropriately titled, "Time dilates spontaneous blinking." paper
published current biology. first author Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. wonderful
paper. examine relationship fluctuations timing blinking
make long story short found right blinks, reset perception
time, okay? blinks sense little bit like curtain coming
scene scenes play takes movie, clap clap thing,
started take our, say, action end thing
click say, take one take blink take,
okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,
disorganized time. dopamine low, know well
underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.
makes perfect sense lose track time ability focus.

makes seem like worthwhile thing everybody. just
talked attentional blinks, essentially blinks thinking mind
shutting off moment missing information. Now talk actual blinks,


sort eyelids. Now, might come across somewhat obvious,
can fast, called spontaneous blinks always coordinated
two eyes can long blinks like go sleep night,
one long blink, not facetious. go sleep night,
shutting eyelids limiting amount information coming
perception time starts drift go sleep. perception time
changes fast, one moment slow meaning frame rate

slow. Time going rate, perception time changed.
Believe not. perception time also changed rapid basis. Moment
moment basis often blink. well-established literature world
neuroscience unlike literature claims blinking sociopathy,
no basis, science blinking relates time perception
good data support it. want just emphasize one study particular, quite
appropriately titled, "Time dilates spontaneous blinking." paper
published current biology. first author Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. wonderful
paper. examine relationship fluctuations timing blinking
make long story short found right blinks, reset perception

okay? Now interesting will immediately make sense
important rate blinking controlled dopamine. means
dopamine controlling attention. Blinks relate attention focus, therefore
dopamine blinking system one way constantly modulate update


perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,

underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.

takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking

dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember

expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,

perception time fortunately, also one can control. basic
takeaway study blinking controls time perception, also levels
dopamine can alter sense time stay here, blinking
dopamine inextricably linked. working together control attention.
dopamine levels go up, people tend overestimate long something lasted,
why? processing time finely slow motion mode.
dopamine levels lower, tend underestimate time intervals. remember
back beginning episode, going people ADHD,
not good managing time, tend run late, disorganized.
not just disorganized space, meaning physical space, around them,
disorganized time. dopamine low, know well
underestimating time intervals makes perfect sense late.

01:37:30 Interoceptive Awareness

basically saying marijuana seems increase people's focus,
can't remember focusing on. Something like discuss just
briefly so-called interoceptive awareness present people ADHD,
children adults. Interoceptive awareness one sense one's internal state

described process, literally 17 minute interoceptive exercise seem
lead improvements one's ability focus longer period time. However,
unlikely due increasing interoceptive awareness per se. probably
wasn't people gain much heightened improved ability understand

01:48:05 DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine

one can use circuits without need chemical intervention.
despite controversy might there, think fair say

01:50:54 Ginko Biloba

can important augment improving symptoms ADHD. also find

there, treatment ADHD narcolepsy, also communities
people trying stay awake long periods time. actively used
military first responders, gaining popularity college campuses people
using alternative Adderall Ritalin excessive amounts
coffee. increase focus dramatic extent, Modafinil typically
expensive, don't know still expensive, one prescription it,
still cost much eight $900 even $1000 month. Armodafinil far less
expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,
lead increases dopamine. So, whereas Ritalin Adderall,
amphetamine, cocaine lead big increases dopamine also re-uptake
mechanisms forth Modafinil weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator
means leaves dopamine around active synopsis,

expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,

expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,

01:51:45 Modafinil & Armodafanil: Dopamine Action & Orexin

attention ADHD definitely take vasodilation vasoconstriction headache issue

armodafinil AR Modafinil. Modafinil armodafinil gaining popularity
there, treatment ADHD narcolepsy, also communities
people trying stay awake long periods time. actively used
military first responders, gaining popularity college campuses people
using alternative Adderall Ritalin excessive amounts
coffee. increase focus dramatic extent, Modafinil typically
expensive, don't know still expensive, one prescription it,
still cost much eight $900 even $1000 month. Armodafinil far less
expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,
lead increases dopamine. So, whereas Ritalin Adderall,
amphetamine, cocaine lead big increases dopamine also re-uptake
mechanisms forth Modafinil weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator

01:56:19 Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC

turned right dose armodafinil zero milligrams. Now may
notice haven't talked much acetylcholine. Acetylcholine neurotransmitter
neuron muscle connections, called neuromuscular junctions
involved generating muscular contractions kinds movements.
Acetylcholine also released two sites brain. little bit nomenclature
again, feel free ignore nomenclature, collection neurons
brain stem send projections forward, kind like sprinkler system

can improve one's ability focus, however, dosaging can tricky dial in.


Sometimes makes people feel euphoric jittery alert

01:48:05 DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine

one can use circuits without need chemical intervention.
despite controversy might there, think fair say
consumption omega-3 fatty acids can positively modulate systems attention
focus. question becomes much EPA, much DHA
differ for, helpful depression, et cetera actually differ reviewing
studies appears threshold level 300 milligrams DHA turns
important inflection point. typically fish oils sources omega-3s will


DHA EPA typically EPA harder get sufficient levels,
meaning take quite lot fish oil order get 1000 milligram
2000 milligram threshold improve mood functions. sake
attention, 10 studies explored detail EPA
component important, convincing studies point fact getting
300 milligrams per day DHA really start see attentional effects.
Now, fortunately, getting sufficient EPA sake mood biological
functions, almost without question, getting 300 milligrams DHA.
usually checks box just fine. interesting another compound
phosphatidylserine explored capacity improve symptoms
ADHD. Again, don't think direct way, rather modulatory way,
appears phosphatidylserine taken two months 200 milligrams per day,
able reduce symptoms ADHD children. not looked adults yet
as, least far know, effect greatly enhanced
consumption omega-3 fatty acids. now starting see synergistic effects
omega-3 fatty acids phosphatidylserine 200 milligrams per day.
something sold counter capsule form, least U.S.
two studies, double-blind studies. carried anywhere one six
months boys girls really boys girls, not men women.
kids age one six seven 12, fairly large number subjects.
147 subjects one case 36 other, takeaway getting sufficient
levels EPA particularly 300 milligram threshold DHA, plus,
interested right you, 200 milligrams phosphatidylserine

01:50:54 Ginko Biloba

can important augment improving symptoms ADHD. also find
literature many claims so-called Ginkgo Biloba,
shown minor effects improving symptoms ADHD, not nearly effective
Ritalin Adderall. Ginkgo Biloba not appropriate many people. one
person, don't ADHD, taken Gingko, even low doses, get
absolutely splitting headaches. people not experience headaches,
known potent vasoconstrictive vasodilating properties vary
depending took compound. exploring


Ginkgo Biloba, will see lot claims Ginkgo Biloba

01:51:45 Modafinil & Armodafanil: Dopamine Action & Orexin

attention ADHD definitely take vasodilation vasoconstriction headache issue
consideration. like talk drug Modafinil closely related drug
armodafinil AR Modafinil. Modafinil armodafinil gaining popularity
there, treatment ADHD narcolepsy, also communities
people trying stay awake long periods time. actively used
military first responders, gaining popularity college campuses people
using alternative Adderall Ritalin excessive amounts
coffee. increase focus dramatic extent, Modafinil typically
expensive, don't know still expensive, one prescription it,
still cost much eight $900 even $1000 month. Armodafinil far less
expensive version, chemically slightly different Modafinil. Regardless price
people taking Modafinil armodafinil. Want emphasize unlike Ritalin
Adderall, Modafinil armodafinil weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitors,
lead increases dopamine. So, whereas Ritalin Adderall,
amphetamine, cocaine lead big increases dopamine also re-uptake
mechanisms forth Modafinil weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator
means leaves dopamine around active synopsis,
gaps neurons, however, also activates systems. acts orexin
system, actually peptide talked episode hunger,
regulates hunger appetite, regulates sleepiness feelings
sleepiness. fact, the, excuse me, orexin also called hypocretin system, orexin

much,

01:56:19 Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC

turned right dose armodafinil zero milligrams. Now may
notice haven't talked much acetylcholine. Acetylcholine neurotransmitter
neuron muscle connections, called neuromuscular junctions
involved generating muscular contractions kinds movements.
Acetylcholine also released two sites brain. little bit nomenclature
again, feel free ignore nomenclature, collection neurons
brain stem send projections forward, kind like sprinkler system
diffuse release acetylcholine neurons reside area structure
called pedunculopontine nucleus, PPN separate collection
neurons basal forebrain called unimaginatively nucleus basalis nucleus


base also hose brain acetylcholine, much specific way.
one sort like sprinkler system one like fire hose
particular location two sources acetylcholine, collaborate activate
particular locations brain, really bring tremendous degree focus
whatever happening particular synapses. focus visual
information auditory information, listening closely saying right
now, just heard closely step rest sentence, no doubt
acetylcholine released sites brain neurons represent
recognition word closely occurred, okay? now example
understanding hopefully picture mind
working, not surprisingly drugs increase cholinergic acetycholine
transmission will increase focus cognition. One compound so-called alpha
GPC, form choline increases acetycholine transmission dosages
high 1200 milligrams per day, high dosage spread out, typically
300 400 milligrams spread throughout day shown offset
effects age-related cognitive decline, improved cognitive functioning people
don't age-related cognitive decline high dose. Typically people
using alpha-GPC study enhance learning kind, will take
somewhere 300 600 milligrams typical. Again,
check doctor, decide safety margins appropriate
obviously want check out, alpha-GPC effective creating
focused way cholinergic system, stimulates acetylcholine release
locations,

01:59:04 L-Tyrosine, (PEA) Phenylethylamine

PPN back brain nucleus basalis front brain.
two counter compounds active use treatment
ADHD use simply trying improve focus first one L-Tyrosine
amino acid acts precursor neuromodulator dopamine now knowing
everything know dopamine, attention circuits involved, come
no surprise people exploring use L-tyrosine purpose. L-
tyrosine lead increases dopamine. fairly long lived L-tyrosine
can improve one's ability focus, however, dosaging can tricky dial in.


Sometimes makes people feel euphoric jittery alert
unable focus well. dosage ranges huge, see evidence 100
milligrams way 1200 milligrams. something really
approached caution, especially people kind underlying
psychiatric mood disorder, dysregulation dopamine system central
many mood disorders depression, also especially mania bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, things sort. something really

02:01:23 Racetams, Noopept

ADHD cognitive focus. last not least terms different
compounds, want mention Racetams. somewhat esoteric
probably haven't heard them, probably know lot
becoming popular. go names like New pepped
things sort. Racetams. illegal certain countries. gray
market countries, sold counter country, U.S.
different margins safety definitely need consult doctor,
especially ADHD, new pepped shown taken, 10
milligrams, twice daily can effective Racetams.
Noopept? Noopept taps cholinergic system, acetylcholine system ways,
similar alpha-GPC, seems slightly higher affinity
