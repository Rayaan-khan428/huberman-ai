00:09:58 Dopamine (Really)

can find registration link caption episode. talk
dopamine. people heard dopamine, hear time now
dopamine hits. actually no thing dopamine hit. actually
way body uses dopamine baseline level dopamine. Meaning
amount dopamine circulating brain body time. turns
important feel generally, whether not good mood,
motivated, et cetera. also can experience peaks dopamine baseline.
Now, specific name neurobiology literature, so-called tonic
phasic release dopamine. explain means couple minutes.
remember nothing else episode, please remember this,
experience something crave something really desirable, really exciting you,


pleasurable. happens afterwards baseline level dopamine drops.
Okay? peaks dopamine, influence much dopamine will generally
circulating afterward. might think, oh, big peak dopamine that,
going feel even better just great event. Not case. actually
happens baseline level dopamine drops. will explain precise
mechanism that. Okay? neuroscience literature, refer tonic
phasic release dopamine. Tonic low level baseline always
circulating, released brain time. phasic peaks ride
baseline. two things interact. really important. going
teach underlying neurobiology, even no background biology,
promise make clear. explain terms mean. excited
teach dopamine, dopamine everything feel
right now listening this, everything will feel hour
now, everything level motivation level desire,
willingness push effort. ever interacted somebody just
doesn't seem drive given up, interacted somebody
seems endless drive energy, looking two
circumstances without question difference level dopamine circulating
system. will factors too, level dopamine primary
determinant motivated are, excited are, outward facing
willing are, lean life pursue things. Dopamine call
neuromodulator. Neuromodulators different neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitters involved dialogue neurons nerve cells.
neurotransmitters tend mediate local communication. Just imagine two people talking
one another concert, communication analogous
communication carried neurotransmitters, whereas neuromodulators influence
communication many neurons. Imagine bunch people dancing
coordinated dance involving 10 20 hundreds people. Neuromodulators
coordinating dance. nervous system means that, dopamine
release changes probability certain neural circuits will active
neural circuits will inactive. Okay? modulates bunch things once,
powerful shifting not just levels energy, also mindset,
also feelings whether not can, cannot accomplish something.
dopamine work do? Well, first all, not just responsible


pleasure, responsible motivation drive. Primarily, psychological level,
also craving. three things sort same. Motivation, drive craving.
also controls time perception, will get deep dopamine can modulate
time perception, important everybody able access increases
dopamine different timescales. turns important not end addicted
substances, also turns important sustain effort happy
person long periods time. think everybody wants. certainly
adaptive life able that. Dopamine also vitally important movement.
explain neural circuits dopamine mindset, dopamine movement
moment, diseases like Parkinson's Lewy bodies dementia, similar
Parkinson's many ways. depletion death dopamine neurons
particular location brain leads shaky movements, challenges
speaking, challenges particular initiating movement. dopamine
depleted elsewhere people Parkinson's Lew's bod, excuse me, Lewy body
dementia also experience drops motivation affect, meaning mood. tend
get depressed on. people properly treated, can, not always,
can recover fluidity movement, ability initiate movement.
almost without question, people feel better psychologically,

00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits Dopamine

not just can move, also dopamine impacts mood
motivation. underlying neural circuits? not
interested biology specific nomenclature, can tune now want,
actually pretty straightforward. two main neural circuits brain
dopamine uses order exert effects. first one pathway goes
area called ventral tegmentum. fancy, ventral just
means bottom, tegmentum actually means floor. bottom brain,
ventral part floor. really low back brain, ventral
tegmentum. goes ventral tegmentum called ventral striatum
prefrontal cortex. Now, lot language, basically call
the, mesocorticolimbic pathway. pathway dopamine influences
motivation, drive craving. involves structures may heard
before. Things like nucleus accumbens prefrontal cortex. pathway


really gets disrupted addictions particular drugs influence
release dopamine like cocaine methamphetamine. talk drugs
today. tap pathway. pursuing partner, boyfriend
girlfriend, pursuing degree school, pursuing finish line race,
tapping so-called mesecorticolimbic pathway. classic reward
pathway mammals. pathway emerges area brain called
substantia nigra. So-called cells area dark,
substantia nigra connects area brain called dorsal striatum. not
surprisingly called nigrostriatal pathway. never done
neuroanatomy, going teach little trick right now. Everything
neuroanatomy, first part word tells neurons are.
second part tells connecting to. say nigropstriatal
pathway, means neurons substantial nigra connect
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway. lot language there, logic there.
Okay? got two pathways. One, mainly movement, right?
substantia nigra dorsal striatum. got pathway, so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway, reward, reinforcement motivation. want
remember two pathways. don't remember two pathways
detail, fine. please remember two pathways,

00:18:14 Dopamine Released: Locally Broadly

turns important later. Now, thing understand
dopamine that, way dopamine released brain body can differ.
Meaning can local, can broad. Now, probably
heard synapses. Synapses little spaces neurons, basically
neurons nerve cells communicate one another making electrically
active, making less electrically active. works.
can imagine one nerve cell another nerve cell little gap them, little
synapse. way one nerve cell causes next nerve cell fire. call
fire really means become electrically active vomits little packets,
call vesicles. little bubbles filled chemical, chemical
enters synapse, docks parks side, neuron.
virtue electrical changes the, call postsynaptic neuron,


chemical will make neuron electrically active less electrically active.
Dopamine can like neurotransmitter neuromodulator. can
one neuron influence another neuron. dopamine can also engage called
volume metric release. Volumetric release like giant vomit gets 50
hundred even thousands cells. local release call synaptic
release, volumetric release. volumetric release like dumping
dopamine system. dopamine incredible can change
way neural circuits work local scale broad scale.
interested tools, like get dopamine? Let tell
part really important take drug supplement
increases level dopamine, influencing local release dopamine
volumetric release. relates back baseline dopamine big peak
baseline. turns important. just allude
important. Many drugs indeed many supplements increase dopamine will
actually make harder sustain dopamine release long periods time.
achieve peaks us craving pursuit things.
Why? get volume metric release, dumping dopamine
everywhere, getting local release, means difference
peak baseline likely smaller. important,
satisfying exciting pleasureful given experience is, doesn't just depend
height peak, depends height peak relative baseline.
increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize
peak baseline ratio. now talked two main neural circuits, one
movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One
local synaptic release. One volume metric release. back mind,

00:22:03 Fast Slow Effects Dopamine

can relate back to, again, baseline versus peaks baseline.


description call spatial effects spatial aspects dopamine.
said connects that, connects this. can get local broad
volumetric release. duration release duration action
dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited
synapse. dopamine will bind so-called postsynaptic
neuron, it'll bind next neuron, sets off cascade. kind like
bucket brigade one thing, getting handed off next, next, next. G
protein-coupled receptors. anytime hear GPCRs G protein-
coupled receptors, pay attention really interesting. slow,
also can multiple cascades effects. can impact even gene expression
level. can change cell actually becomes. can change
well poorly cell will respond signal future. dopamine
works slower process. G protein-coupled receptors. effects
tend take order occur. aspect dopamine transmission important
now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can
slow effects, really slow effects, even long lasting effects.



00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine
system one time compared much dopamine system
minutes ago, much remember enjoying particular experience past.
dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing

fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle

many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can

can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly

Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work

Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

can find registration link caption episode. talk
dopamine. people heard dopamine, hear time now
dopamine hits. actually no thing dopamine hit. actually
way body uses dopamine baseline level dopamine. Meaning
amount dopamine circulating brain body time. turns
important feel generally, whether not good mood,
motivated, et cetera. also can experience peaks dopamine baseline.
Now, specific name neurobiology literature, so-called tonic
phasic release dopamine. explain means couple minutes.
remember nothing else episode, please remember this,
experience something crave something really desirable, really exciting you,


pleasurable. happens afterwards baseline level dopamine drops.
Okay? peaks dopamine, influence much dopamine will generally
circulating afterward. might think, oh, big peak dopamine that,
going feel even better just great event. Not case. actually
happens baseline level dopamine drops. will explain precise
mechanism that. Okay? neuroscience literature, refer tonic
phasic release dopamine. Tonic low level baseline always
circulating, released brain time. phasic peaks ride
baseline. two things interact. really important. going
teach underlying neurobiology, even no background biology,
promise make clear. explain terms mean. excited
teach dopamine, dopamine everything feel
right now listening this, everything will feel hour
now, everything level motivation level desire,
willingness push effort. ever interacted somebody just
doesn't seem drive given up, interacted somebody
seems endless drive energy, looking two
circumstances without question difference level dopamine circulating
system. will factors too, level dopamine primary
determinant motivated are, excited are, outward facing
willing are, lean life pursue things. Dopamine call
neuromodulator. Neuromodulators different neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitters involved dialogue neurons nerve cells.
neurotransmitters tend mediate local communication. Just imagine two people talking
one another concert, communication analogous
communication carried neurotransmitters, whereas neuromodulators influence
communication many neurons. Imagine bunch people dancing
coordinated dance involving 10 20 hundreds people. Neuromodulators
coordinating dance. nervous system means that, dopamine
release changes probability certain neural circuits will active
neural circuits will inactive. Okay? modulates bunch things once,
powerful shifting not just levels energy, also mindset,
also feelings whether not can, cannot accomplish something.
dopamine work do? Well, first all, not just responsible


pleasure, responsible motivation drive. Primarily, psychological level,
also craving. three things sort same. Motivation, drive craving.
also controls time perception, will get deep dopamine can modulate
time perception, important everybody able access increases
dopamine different timescales. turns important not end addicted
substances, also turns important sustain effort happy
person long periods time. think everybody wants. certainly
adaptive life able that. Dopamine also vitally important movement.
explain neural circuits dopamine mindset, dopamine movement
moment, diseases like Parkinson's Lewy bodies dementia, similar
Parkinson's many ways. depletion death dopamine neurons
particular location brain leads shaky movements, challenges
speaking, challenges particular initiating movement. dopamine
depleted elsewhere people Parkinson's Lew's bod, excuse me, Lewy body
dementia also experience drops motivation affect, meaning mood. tend
get depressed on. people properly treated, can, not always,
can recover fluidity movement, ability initiate movement.
almost without question, people feel better psychologically,

00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits Dopamine

not just can move, also dopamine impacts mood
motivation. underlying neural circuits? not
interested biology specific nomenclature, can tune now want,
actually pretty straightforward. two main neural circuits brain
dopamine uses order exert effects. first one pathway goes
area called ventral tegmentum. fancy, ventral just
means bottom, tegmentum actually means floor. bottom brain,
ventral part floor. really low back brain, ventral
tegmentum. goes ventral tegmentum called ventral striatum
prefrontal cortex. Now, lot language, basically call
the, mesocorticolimbic pathway. pathway dopamine influences
motivation, drive craving. involves structures may heard
before. Things like nucleus accumbens prefrontal cortex. pathway


really gets disrupted addictions particular drugs influence
release dopamine like cocaine methamphetamine. talk drugs
today. tap pathway. pursuing partner, boyfriend
girlfriend, pursuing degree school, pursuing finish line race,
tapping so-called mesecorticolimbic pathway. classic reward
pathway mammals. pathway emerges area brain called
substantia nigra. So-called cells area dark,
substantia nigra connects area brain called dorsal striatum. not
surprisingly called nigrostriatal pathway. never done
neuroanatomy, going teach little trick right now. Everything
neuroanatomy, first part word tells neurons are.
second part tells connecting to. say nigropstriatal
pathway, means neurons substantial nigra connect
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway. lot language there, logic there.
Okay? got two pathways. One, mainly movement, right?
substantia nigra dorsal striatum. got pathway, so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway, reward, reinforcement motivation. want
remember two pathways. don't remember two pathways
detail, fine. please remember two pathways,

00:18:14 Dopamine Released: Locally Broadly

turns important later. Now, thing understand
dopamine that, way dopamine released brain body can differ.
Meaning can local, can broad. Now, probably
heard synapses. Synapses little spaces neurons, basically
neurons nerve cells communicate one another making electrically
active, making less electrically active. works.
can imagine one nerve cell another nerve cell little gap them, little
synapse. way one nerve cell causes next nerve cell fire. call
fire really means become electrically active vomits little packets,
call vesicles. little bubbles filled chemical, chemical
enters synapse, docks parks side, neuron.
virtue electrical changes the, call postsynaptic neuron,


chemical will make neuron electrically active less electrically active.
Dopamine can like neurotransmitter neuromodulator. can
one neuron influence another neuron. dopamine can also engage called
volume metric release. Volumetric release like giant vomit gets 50
hundred even thousands cells. local release call synaptic
release, volumetric release. volumetric release like dumping
dopamine system. dopamine incredible can change
way neural circuits work local scale broad scale.
interested tools, like get dopamine? Let tell
part really important take drug supplement
increases level dopamine, influencing local release dopamine
volumetric release. relates back baseline dopamine big peak
baseline. turns important. just allude
important. Many drugs indeed many supplements increase dopamine will
actually make harder sustain dopamine release long periods time.
achieve peaks us craving pursuit things.
Why? get volume metric release, dumping dopamine
everywhere, getting local release, means difference
peak baseline likely smaller. important,
satisfying exciting pleasureful given experience is, doesn't just depend
height peak, depends height peak relative baseline.
increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize
peak baseline ratio. now talked two main neural circuits, one
movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One
local synaptic release. One volume metric release. back mind,

00:22:03 Fast Slow Effects Dopamine

can relate back to, again, baseline versus peaks baseline.


description call spatial effects spatial aspects dopamine.
said connects that, connects this. can get local broad
volumetric release. duration release duration action
dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited
synapse. dopamine will bind so-called postsynaptic
neuron, it'll bind next neuron, sets off cascade. kind like
bucket brigade one thing, getting handed off next, next, next. G
protein-coupled receptors. anytime hear GPCRs G protein-
coupled receptors, pay attention really interesting. slow,
also can multiple cascades effects. can impact even gene expression
level. can change cell actually becomes. can change
well poorly cell will respond signal future. dopamine
works slower process. G protein-coupled receptors. effects
tend take order occur. aspect dopamine transmission important
now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can
slow effects, really slow effects, even long lasting effects.



00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine
system one time compared much dopamine system
minutes ago, much remember enjoying particular experience past.
dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much

Now, course, going variation there, average increase

so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience

talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing

will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle

many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe

lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity

thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

dopamine hits. actually no thing dopamine hit. actually
way body uses dopamine baseline level dopamine. Meaning
amount dopamine circulating brain body time. turns
important feel generally, whether not good mood,
motivated, et cetera. also can experience peaks dopamine baseline.
Now, specific name neurobiology literature, so-called tonic
phasic release dopamine. explain means couple minutes.
remember nothing else episode, please remember this,
experience something crave something really desirable, really exciting you,


pleasurable. happens afterwards baseline level dopamine drops.
Okay? peaks dopamine, influence much dopamine will generally
circulating afterward. might think, oh, big peak dopamine that,
going feel even better just great event. Not case. actually
happens baseline level dopamine drops. will explain precise
mechanism that. Okay? neuroscience literature, refer tonic
phasic release dopamine. Tonic low level baseline always
circulating, released brain time. phasic peaks ride
baseline. two things interact. really important. going
teach underlying neurobiology, even no background biology,
promise make clear. explain terms mean. excited
teach dopamine, dopamine everything feel
right now listening this, everything will feel hour
now, everything level motivation level desire,
willingness push effort. ever interacted somebody just
doesn't seem drive given up, interacted somebody
seems endless drive energy, looking two
circumstances without question difference level dopamine circulating
system. will factors too, level dopamine primary
determinant motivated are, excited are, outward facing
willing are, lean life pursue things. Dopamine call
neuromodulator. Neuromodulators different neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitters involved dialogue neurons nerve cells.
neurotransmitters tend mediate local communication. Just imagine two people talking
one another concert, communication analogous
communication carried neurotransmitters, whereas neuromodulators influence
communication many neurons. Imagine bunch people dancing
coordinated dance involving 10 20 hundreds people. Neuromodulators
coordinating dance. nervous system means that, dopamine
release changes probability certain neural circuits will active
neural circuits will inactive. Okay? modulates bunch things once,
powerful shifting not just levels energy, also mindset,
also feelings whether not can, cannot accomplish something.
dopamine work do? Well, first all, not just responsible


pleasure, responsible motivation drive. Primarily, psychological level,
also craving. three things sort same. Motivation, drive craving.
also controls time perception, will get deep dopamine can modulate
time perception, important everybody able access increases
dopamine different timescales. turns important not end addicted
substances, also turns important sustain effort happy
person long periods time. think everybody wants. certainly
adaptive life able that. Dopamine also vitally important movement.
explain neural circuits dopamine mindset, dopamine movement
moment, diseases like Parkinson's Lewy bodies dementia, similar
Parkinson's many ways. depletion death dopamine neurons
particular location brain leads shaky movements, challenges
speaking, challenges particular initiating movement. dopamine
depleted elsewhere people Parkinson's Lew's bod, excuse me, Lewy body
dementia also experience drops motivation affect, meaning mood. tend
get depressed on. people properly treated, can, not always,
can recover fluidity movement, ability initiate movement.
almost without question, people feel better psychologically,

00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits Dopamine

not just can move, also dopamine impacts mood
motivation. underlying neural circuits? not
interested biology specific nomenclature, can tune now want,
actually pretty straightforward. two main neural circuits brain
dopamine uses order exert effects. first one pathway goes
area called ventral tegmentum. fancy, ventral just
means bottom, tegmentum actually means floor. bottom brain,
ventral part floor. really low back brain, ventral
tegmentum. goes ventral tegmentum called ventral striatum
prefrontal cortex. Now, lot language, basically call
the, mesocorticolimbic pathway. pathway dopamine influences
motivation, drive craving. involves structures may heard
before. Things like nucleus accumbens prefrontal cortex. pathway


really gets disrupted addictions particular drugs influence
release dopamine like cocaine methamphetamine. talk drugs
today. tap pathway. pursuing partner, boyfriend
girlfriend, pursuing degree school, pursuing finish line race,
tapping so-called mesecorticolimbic pathway. classic reward
pathway mammals. pathway emerges area brain called
substantia nigra. So-called cells area dark,
substantia nigra connects area brain called dorsal striatum. not
surprisingly called nigrostriatal pathway. never done
neuroanatomy, going teach little trick right now. Everything
neuroanatomy, first part word tells neurons are.
second part tells connecting to. say nigropstriatal
pathway, means neurons substantial nigra connect
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway. lot language there, logic there.
Okay? got two pathways. One, mainly movement, right?
substantia nigra dorsal striatum. got pathway, so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway, reward, reinforcement motivation. want
remember two pathways. don't remember two pathways
detail, fine. please remember two pathways,

00:18:14 Dopamine Released: Locally Broadly

turns important later. Now, thing understand
dopamine that, way dopamine released brain body can differ.
Meaning can local, can broad. Now, probably
heard synapses. Synapses little spaces neurons, basically
neurons nerve cells communicate one another making electrically
active, making less electrically active. works.
can imagine one nerve cell another nerve cell little gap them, little
synapse. way one nerve cell causes next nerve cell fire. call
fire really means become electrically active vomits little packets,
call vesicles. little bubbles filled chemical, chemical
enters synapse, docks parks side, neuron.
virtue electrical changes the, call postsynaptic neuron,


chemical will make neuron electrically active less electrically active.
Dopamine can like neurotransmitter neuromodulator. can
one neuron influence another neuron. dopamine can also engage called
volume metric release. Volumetric release like giant vomit gets 50
hundred even thousands cells. local release call synaptic
release, volumetric release. volumetric release like dumping
dopamine system. dopamine incredible can change
way neural circuits work local scale broad scale.
interested tools, like get dopamine? Let tell
part really important take drug supplement
increases level dopamine, influencing local release dopamine
volumetric release. relates back baseline dopamine big peak
baseline. turns important. just allude
important. Many drugs indeed many supplements increase dopamine will
actually make harder sustain dopamine release long periods time.
achieve peaks us craving pursuit things.
Why? get volume metric release, dumping dopamine
everywhere, getting local release, means difference
peak baseline likely smaller. important,
satisfying exciting pleasureful given experience is, doesn't just depend
height peak, depends height peak relative baseline.
increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize
peak baseline ratio. now talked two main neural circuits, one
movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One
local synaptic release. One volume metric release. back mind,

00:22:03 Fast Slow Effects Dopamine

can relate back to, again, baseline versus peaks baseline.


description call spatial effects spatial aspects dopamine.
said connects that, connects this. can get local broad
volumetric release. duration release duration action
dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited
synapse. dopamine will bind so-called postsynaptic
neuron, it'll bind next neuron, sets off cascade. kind like
bucket brigade one thing, getting handed off next, next, next. G
protein-coupled receptors. anytime hear GPCRs G protein-
coupled receptors, pay attention really interesting. slow,
also can multiple cascades effects. can impact even gene expression
level. can change cell actually becomes. can change
well poorly cell will respond signal future. dopamine
works slower process. G protein-coupled receptors. effects
tend take order occur. aspect dopamine transmission important
now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can
slow effects, really slow effects, even long lasting effects.



00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,

scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine

biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able

reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line

otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum

important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement

want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine

pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle

many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe

lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks

can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first

01:26:15 Amphetamine, Cocaine & Detrimental Rewiring Dopamine Circuits

not dangerous substance another context. Two substances greatly increase
dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds
National Academy Sciences, high tier stringent journal. First author Kolb, K-
O-L-B. title paper pretty much tells story. Amphetamine cocaine

01:27:57 Ritalin, Adderall, (Ar)Modafinil: ADHD versus non-Prescription Uses

cannot learn modify get better least period time.
previous episode ADHD, talked widespread use drugs like Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil armodafinil, lead large increases dopamine,
people ADHD can really improve symptoms. course lot
non-prescription, non-clinical use compounds well. stands reason
use substances increase dopamine well provide
sort blockade neuroplasticity cocaine amphetamine do.
look amount dopamine increase triggered compounds, really
comparable. again, cautionary note spiking one's dopamine

01:28:45 Tool 6 Stimulating Long-Lasting Increases Baseline Dopamine

much regular basis, unless valid clinical need that.
focusing lot last minutes kind darker side dopamine
getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

pleasurable. happens afterwards baseline level dopamine drops.
Okay? peaks dopamine, influence much dopamine will generally
circulating afterward. might think, oh, big peak dopamine that,
going feel even better just great event. Not case. actually
happens baseline level dopamine drops. will explain precise
mechanism that. Okay? neuroscience literature, refer tonic
phasic release dopamine. Tonic low level baseline always
circulating, released brain time. phasic peaks ride

circumstances without question difference level dopamine circulating
system. will factors too, level dopamine primary
determinant motivated are, excited are, outward facing
willing are, lean life pursue things. Dopamine call
neuromodulator. Neuromodulators different neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitters involved dialogue neurons nerve cells.
neurotransmitters tend mediate local communication. Just imagine two people talking
one another concert, communication analogous
communication carried neurotransmitters, whereas neuromodulators influence
communication many neurons. Imagine bunch people dancing
coordinated dance involving 10 20 hundreds people. Neuromodulators
coordinating dance. nervous system means that, dopamine
release changes probability certain neural circuits will active
neural circuits will inactive. Okay? modulates bunch things once,
powerful shifting not just levels energy, also mindset,
also feelings whether not can, cannot accomplish something.
dopamine work do? Well, first all, not just responsible


pleasure, responsible motivation drive. Primarily, psychological level,
also craving. three things sort same. Motivation, drive craving.
also controls time perception, will get deep dopamine can modulate
time perception, important everybody able access increases
dopamine different timescales. turns important not end addicted
substances, also turns important sustain effort happy
person long periods time. think everybody wants. certainly
adaptive life able that. Dopamine also vitally important movement.
explain neural circuits dopamine mindset, dopamine movement
moment, diseases like Parkinson's Lewy bodies dementia, similar
Parkinson's many ways. depletion death dopamine neurons
particular location brain leads shaky movements, challenges
speaking, challenges particular initiating movement. dopamine
depleted elsewhere people Parkinson's Lew's bod, excuse me, Lewy body
dementia also experience drops motivation affect, meaning mood. tend
get depressed on. people properly treated, can, not always,
can recover fluidity movement, ability initiate movement.
almost without question, people feel better psychologically,

00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits Dopamine

not just can move, also dopamine impacts mood
motivation. underlying neural circuits? not
interested biology specific nomenclature, can tune now want,
actually pretty straightforward. two main neural circuits brain
dopamine uses order exert effects. first one pathway goes
area called ventral tegmentum. fancy, ventral just
means bottom, tegmentum actually means floor. bottom brain,
ventral part floor. really low back brain, ventral
tegmentum. goes ventral tegmentum called ventral striatum
prefrontal cortex. Now, lot language, basically call
the, mesocorticolimbic pathway. pathway dopamine influences
motivation, drive craving. involves structures may heard
before. Things like nucleus accumbens prefrontal cortex. pathway


really gets disrupted addictions particular drugs influence
release dopamine like cocaine methamphetamine. talk drugs
today. tap pathway. pursuing partner, boyfriend
girlfriend, pursuing degree school, pursuing finish line race,
tapping so-called mesecorticolimbic pathway. classic reward
pathway mammals. pathway emerges area brain called
substantia nigra. So-called cells area dark,
substantia nigra connects area brain called dorsal striatum. not
surprisingly called nigrostriatal pathway. never done
neuroanatomy, going teach little trick right now. Everything
neuroanatomy, first part word tells neurons are.
second part tells connecting to. say nigropstriatal
pathway, means neurons substantial nigra connect
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway. lot language there, logic there.
Okay? got two pathways. One, mainly movement, right?
substantia nigra dorsal striatum. got pathway, so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway, reward, reinforcement motivation. want
remember two pathways. don't remember two pathways
detail, fine. please remember two pathways,

00:18:14 Dopamine Released: Locally Broadly

turns important later. Now, thing understand
dopamine that, way dopamine released brain body can differ.
Meaning can local, can broad. Now, probably
heard synapses. Synapses little spaces neurons, basically
neurons nerve cells communicate one another making electrically
active, making less electrically active. works.
can imagine one nerve cell another nerve cell little gap them, little
synapse. way one nerve cell causes next nerve cell fire. call
fire really means become electrically active vomits little packets,
call vesicles. little bubbles filled chemical, chemical
enters synapse, docks parks side, neuron.
virtue electrical changes the, call postsynaptic neuron,


chemical will make neuron electrically active less electrically active.
Dopamine can like neurotransmitter neuromodulator. can
one neuron influence another neuron. dopamine can also engage called
volume metric release. Volumetric release like giant vomit gets 50
hundred even thousands cells. local release call synaptic
release, volumetric release. volumetric release like dumping
dopamine system. dopamine incredible can change
way neural circuits work local scale broad scale.
interested tools, like get dopamine? Let tell
part really important take drug supplement
increases level dopamine, influencing local release dopamine
volumetric release. relates back baseline dopamine big peak
baseline. turns important. just allude
important. Many drugs indeed many supplements increase dopamine will
actually make harder sustain dopamine release long periods time.
achieve peaks us craving pursuit things.
Why? get volume metric release, dumping dopamine
everywhere, getting local release, means difference
peak baseline likely smaller. important,
satisfying exciting pleasureful given experience is, doesn't just depend
height peak, depends height peak relative baseline.
increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize
peak baseline ratio. now talked two main neural circuits, one
movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One
local synaptic release. One volume metric release. back mind,

00:22:03 Fast Slow Effects Dopamine

can relate back to, again, baseline versus peaks baseline.


description call spatial effects spatial aspects dopamine.
said connects that, connects this. can get local broad
volumetric release. duration release duration action
dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited
synapse. dopamine will bind so-called postsynaptic
neuron, it'll bind next neuron, sets off cascade. kind like
bucket brigade one thing, getting handed off next, next, next. G
protein-coupled receptors. anytime hear GPCRs G protein-
coupled receptors, pay attention really interesting. slow,
also can multiple cascades effects. can impact even gene expression
level. can change cell actually becomes. can change
well poorly cell will respond signal future. dopamine
works slower process. G protein-coupled receptors. effects
tend take order occur. aspect dopamine transmission important
now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can
slow effects, really slow effects, even long lasting effects.



00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine
system one time compared much dopamine system
minutes ago, much remember enjoying particular experience past.
dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous

talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine

First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-

pleasure, responsible motivation drive. Primarily, psychological level,
also craving. three things sort same. Motivation, drive craving.
also controls time perception, will get deep dopamine can modulate
time perception, important everybody able access increases
dopamine different timescales. turns important not end addicted
substances, also turns important sustain effort happy
person long periods time. think everybody wants. certainly
adaptive life able that. Dopamine also vitally important movement.
explain neural circuits dopamine mindset, dopamine movement
moment, diseases like Parkinson's Lewy bodies dementia, similar
Parkinson's many ways. depletion death dopamine neurons
particular location brain leads shaky movements, challenges
speaking, challenges particular initiating movement. dopamine
depleted elsewhere people Parkinson's Lew's bod, excuse me, Lewy body
dementia also experience drops motivation affect, meaning mood. tend
get depressed on. people properly treated, can, not always,
can recover fluidity movement, ability initiate movement.
almost without question, people feel better psychologically,

00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits Dopamine

not just can move, also dopamine impacts mood
motivation. underlying neural circuits? not
interested biology specific nomenclature, can tune now want,
actually pretty straightforward. two main neural circuits brain
dopamine uses order exert effects. first one pathway goes
area called ventral tegmentum. fancy, ventral just
means bottom, tegmentum actually means floor. bottom brain,
ventral part floor. really low back brain, ventral
tegmentum. goes ventral tegmentum called ventral striatum
prefrontal cortex. Now, lot language, basically call
the, mesocorticolimbic pathway. pathway dopamine influences
motivation, drive craving. involves structures may heard
before. Things like nucleus accumbens prefrontal cortex. pathway


really gets disrupted addictions particular drugs influence
release dopamine like cocaine methamphetamine. talk drugs
today. tap pathway. pursuing partner, boyfriend
girlfriend, pursuing degree school, pursuing finish line race,
tapping so-called mesecorticolimbic pathway. classic reward
pathway mammals. pathway emerges area brain called
substantia nigra. So-called cells area dark,
substantia nigra connects area brain called dorsal striatum. not
surprisingly called nigrostriatal pathway. never done
neuroanatomy, going teach little trick right now. Everything
neuroanatomy, first part word tells neurons are.
second part tells connecting to. say nigropstriatal
pathway, means neurons substantial nigra connect
striatum, nigrostriatal pathway. lot language there, logic there.
Okay? got two pathways. One, mainly movement, right?
substantia nigra dorsal striatum. got pathway, so-called
mesocorticolimbic pathway, reward, reinforcement motivation. want
remember two pathways. don't remember two pathways
detail, fine. please remember two pathways,

00:18:14 Dopamine Released: Locally Broadly

turns important later. Now, thing understand
dopamine that, way dopamine released brain body can differ.
Meaning can local, can broad. Now, probably
heard synapses. Synapses little spaces neurons, basically
neurons nerve cells communicate one another making electrically
active, making less electrically active. works.
can imagine one nerve cell another nerve cell little gap them, little
synapse. way one nerve cell causes next nerve cell fire. call
fire really means become electrically active vomits little packets,
call vesicles. little bubbles filled chemical, chemical
enters synapse, docks parks side, neuron.
virtue electrical changes the, call postsynaptic neuron,


chemical will make neuron electrically active less electrically active.
Dopamine can like neurotransmitter neuromodulator. can
one neuron influence another neuron. dopamine can also engage called
volume metric release. Volumetric release like giant vomit gets 50
hundred even thousands cells. local release call synaptic
release, volumetric release. volumetric release like dumping
dopamine system. dopamine incredible can change
way neural circuits work local scale broad scale.
interested tools, like get dopamine? Let tell
part really important take drug supplement
increases level dopamine, influencing local release dopamine
volumetric release. relates back baseline dopamine big peak
baseline. turns important. just allude
important. Many drugs indeed many supplements increase dopamine will
actually make harder sustain dopamine release long periods time.
achieve peaks us craving pursuit things.
Why? get volume metric release, dumping dopamine
everywhere, getting local release, means difference
peak baseline likely smaller. important,
satisfying exciting pleasureful given experience is, doesn't just depend
height peak, depends height peak relative baseline.
increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize
peak baseline ratio. now talked two main neural circuits, one
movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One
local synaptic release. One volume metric release. back mind,

00:22:03 Fast Slow Effects Dopamine

can relate back to, again, baseline versus peaks baseline.


description call spatial effects spatial aspects dopamine.
said connects that, connects this. can get local broad
volumetric release. duration release duration action
dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited
synapse. dopamine will bind so-called postsynaptic
neuron, it'll bind next neuron, sets off cascade. kind like
bucket brigade one thing, getting handed off next, next, next. G
protein-coupled receptors. anytime hear GPCRs G protein-
coupled receptors, pay attention really interesting. slow,
also can multiple cascades effects. can impact even gene expression
level. can change cell actually becomes. can change
well poorly cell will respond signal future. dopamine
works slower process. G protein-coupled receptors. effects
tend take order occur. aspect dopamine transmission important
now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can
slow effects, really slow effects, even long lasting effects.



00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine
system one time compared much dopamine system
minutes ago, much remember enjoying particular experience past.
dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine

Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances

helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred

effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

00:18:14 Dopamine Released: Locally Broadly

turns important later. Now, thing understand
dopamine that, way dopamine released brain body can differ.
Meaning can local, can broad. Now, probably
heard synapses. Synapses little spaces neurons, basically
neurons nerve cells communicate one another making electrically
active, making less electrically active. works.
can imagine one nerve cell another nerve cell little gap them, little
synapse. way one nerve cell causes next nerve cell fire. call
fire really means become electrically active vomits little packets,
call vesicles. little bubbles filled chemical, chemical
enters synapse, docks parks side, neuron.
virtue electrical changes the, call postsynaptic neuron,


chemical will make neuron electrically active less electrically active.
Dopamine can like neurotransmitter neuromodulator. can
one neuron influence another neuron. dopamine can also engage called
volume metric release. Volumetric release like giant vomit gets 50
hundred even thousands cells. local release call synaptic
release, volumetric release. volumetric release like dumping
dopamine system. dopamine incredible can change
way neural circuits work local scale broad scale.
interested tools, like get dopamine? Let tell
part really important take drug supplement
increases level dopamine, influencing local release dopamine
volumetric release. relates back baseline dopamine big peak
baseline. turns important. just allude
important. Many drugs indeed many supplements increase dopamine will
actually make harder sustain dopamine release long periods time.
achieve peaks us craving pursuit things.
Why? get volume metric release, dumping dopamine
everywhere, getting local release, means difference
peak baseline likely smaller. important,
satisfying exciting pleasureful given experience is, doesn't just depend
height peak, depends height peak relative baseline.
increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize
peak baseline ratio. now talked two main neural circuits, one
movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One
local synaptic release. One volume metric release. back mind,

00:22:03 Fast Slow Effects Dopamine

can relate back to, again, baseline versus peaks baseline.


description call spatial effects spatial aspects dopamine.
said connects that, connects this. can get local broad
volumetric release. duration release duration action
dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited
synapse. dopamine will bind so-called postsynaptic
neuron, it'll bind next neuron, sets off cascade. kind like
bucket brigade one thing, getting handed off next, next, next. G
protein-coupled receptors. anytime hear GPCRs G protein-
coupled receptors, pay attention really interesting. slow,
also can multiple cascades effects. can impact even gene expression
level. can change cell actually becomes. can change
well poorly cell will respond signal future. dopamine
works slower process. G protein-coupled receptors. effects
tend take order occur. aspect dopamine transmission important
now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can
slow effects, really slow effects, even long lasting effects.



00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine
system one time compared much dopamine system
minutes ago, much remember enjoying particular experience past.
dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands

like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous

dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine

can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

increase baseline increase peak, not going achieve
pleasure things. talk leverage information little
bit, just increasing dopamine. Yes, will make excited things. will
make feel motivated, will also make motivation short-lived.
better way increase dopamine. better way optimize

movement, one motivation craving dopamine. talked
two main modes communication neurons dopamine. One

dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled

hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic

go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine
slower. works called G protein-coupled receptors. happens
dopamine released little vesicles mentioned before, get vomited

now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can

00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body

crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine

important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine

00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.

talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable

something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing

scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle

many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can

lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high

really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels

people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

dopamine? Well, dopamine unique among chemicals brain, dopamine
unlike lot chemicals brain works called G protein-coupled
receptors. pass amount detail, just
hang me. really not complicated. two ways neurons can
communicate mainly two ways. third fourth, mostly neurons
communicate two modes. One, call fast electrical synapses ionotropic
conduction. right? don't need know means, basically one neuron
activates another neuron little holes open neuron, ions rush in.
Sodium main ion salt one neuron influences electrical activity
another neuron sodium ions contain charge. Okay? things
like chloride potassium. interested looking up, just look ionic
conductances action potential, post time
go detail. just understand neurons want influence other,
can way fast ionotropic conduction. really quick way one
neuron influence next. Dopamine doesn't communicate way. Dopamine

now underscores two things. One, two pathways dopamine
communicate. One movement, one motivation craving. two spatial
scales dopamine can operate synaptically volumetrically. dopamine can

00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,

dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine

00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead

leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands

go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line

types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable

something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing

scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle

many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can

lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks

going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit

useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate

even can control gene expression. can actually change way cells
behave. One thing not often discussed dopamine, extremely important
know dopamine doesn't work own. Neurons release dopamine co-
release glutamate. Glutamate neurotransmitter neurotransmitter
excitatory, meaning stimulates neurons electrically active. now even
don't know cell biology, start gain picture dopamine
responsible movement, motivation drive. two pathways,
also dopamine stimulates action general, releases excitatory
neurotransmitter. tends make certain neurons nearby even far
away, volumetric release, tends make active. dopamine
really stimulating. indeed say dopaminergic transmission dopamine
tends stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't anything
sympathy. just simply means tends increase levels alertness. tends
bring animal human state alertness, readiness desire
pursue things outside confines skin. just put really simple
message around dopamine be, molecule brain body
released tends make look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself,
crave things outside yourself. pleasure arrives achieving things also
involves dopamine, mainly consequences molecules. ever
felt lethargic like just lazy no motivation drive, low dopamine
state. ever felt really excited, motivated, even little scared
something. Maybe first skydive, first skydive,
public speaking really don't want screw up,
high dopamine state. Dopamine universal currency mammals,
especially humans moving us toward goals much dopamine
system one time compared much dopamine system
minutes ago, much remember enjoying particular experience past.
dictates so-called quality life desire pursue things. really
important. Dopamine currency, way track pleasure. way
track success. way track whether not well
poorly. subjective, dopamine low, will not feel


motivated. dopamine really high, will feel motivated.

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can

guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first

treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not

useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

00:28:00 Dopamine History Really Matters

dopamine somewhere middle, feel depends whether
not higher dopamine minutes ago lower dopamine. important,
experience life level motivation drive depends much
dopamine relative recent experience. again, something
just not accounted simple language dopamine hits. Okay? simple way
envision dopamine hits every time something like, piece
chocolate, dopamine hit. look Instagram, dopamine hit. see someone
like, dopamine hit. things described dopamine hits neglect fact
scroll social media see something really like, dopamine hit. Sure
increase dopamine, get something else go, hmm, not
interesting. However, arrived second thing first, might think
really interesting. arrived second Instagram post three days later
four days later, might find extremely interesting. Again, much dopamine
experience something depends baseline level dopamine
arrive there, previous dopamine peaks. Okay? super important
understand, completely neglected general language dopamine hits.
repeatedly engage something enjoy, threshold
enjoyment goes up. want talk process. want
explain process works, understand process,
understand schedules kinetics call around dopamine,
will terrific position use dopamine enhancing tools decide
use. excellent position modulate control dopamine
release optimal motivation drive. realized lot information
biology dopamine, sort like trying make drink fire hose dopamine
biology. However, realized people probably want even information
biology dopamine transmission. interested that, post link
absolutely stellar review published Nature Reviews Neuroscience called
spatial temporal scales dopamine transmission. quite detailed,
beautiful diagrams can walk things just described get
even detail.



00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first

treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine

influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs Kill Dopamine Neurons. Dopamine Experience

put link caption YouTube. Right now, want share
two anecdotes, one life, one fairly recent history
illustrate core biology dopamine profoundly can shape
experience. first one really tragic situation occurred. 80s,
outbreak looked like Parkinsonian symptoms young population.
many heard Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease disease
people initially start quake, can't generate smooth movements, issues
speech, sometimes cognition well. examples like Michael J. Fox,
kind early onset. Parkinson's typically hits people little bit later life.
genetic component. question, always question
whether not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? years ago
situation street laboratories, illicit laboratories trying make
drug called MPPP, opioid light compound. bit like heroin, heroin
addicts seeking heroin went bought thought MPPP.
Unfortunately, not MPPP. mean, tragic anyway
drug addicts, ended taking turned lot
worse. ended taking MPTP, MPTP can arise synthesis
MPPP. someone lab someplace, mainly Central Valley
California, elsewhere well. Somebody created MPTP, ended
happening large number young people opioid addicts became
completely boxed paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't anything.
Couldn't function, couldn't move. aspects dopamine transmission
disrupted. no motivation drive. couldn't generate movement
kind. literally locked frozen. sadly, irreversible.
irreversible, MPTP kills dopaminergic neurons
substantia nigra nigrostriatal pathway involved generating movement.
kills dopaminergic neurons so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.
college whole MPTP thing happened. remember hearing story.
time, no understanding high levels dopamine
extremely depleted levels dopamine. no reason
understanding. mean, course experienced different pleasures different kinds


lows life, nothing extreme discuss. got
Giardia. Giardia stomach bug ever it, terrible.
terrible diarrhea. end dehydrated quickly. drop ton weight
extremely unpleasant. ended going emergency room,
emergency room, begged something stop guts. gave
me. put saline line rehydrate injected something saline
bag. within minutes felt sadness, overwhelming sense depression,
basically, lower ever felt entire life. absolutely profound. crying
endlessly without knowing crying. miserable. asked them,
inject? said, "We injected Thorazine." Thorazine antipsychotic
drug. actually used block dopamine receptors. given people
schizophrenia. Often given people schizophrenia, schizophrenia
involves among things elevated levels dopamine. horrible.
experience miserable, unlike anything ever experienced. actually
said them, "What give me?" said, "Thorazine." said, "You
give l-DOPA. "You give something get dopamine levels "back
again." did. gave injection l-DOPA bag, went straight
bloodstream. within minutes felt fine again. incredible. really
opened mind experience absolutely plummeted levels
dopamine. nothing miserable tell you. poor
souls MPTP experience, unfortunately, couldn't recover cells.
People severe Parkinson's struggling well,
Parkinson's Lewy body dementia, dopaminergic neurons often die. not just
problem neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, going talk
approaches maintaining dopaminergic neuron health things
can that. will tell dopamine neurons
precious movement mood motivation. experienced
very, low levels dopamine case dopamine receptors blocked
Thorazine eye-opening say least, given tremendous
sensitivity fact dopamine perhaps one powerful molecules
us inside us. one think carefully
leverage, experiences things do, take
eat cetera, won't create enormous highs enormous lows dopamine. Even
subtle fluctuations dopamine really shape perception life


capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands
years. present every animal, not just mammals, even little worms
like C. elegans, process. mediated dopamine. dopamine drives
go look things. say find couple berries,
ones rotten, ones good. Maybe hunt animal kill it, find
animal recently killed decide take meat. going
achieve, say, experience sort dopamine release. found
reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop
baseline. anyone experienced real drop baseline addictive
tendencies, whether not behaviors substances, always going
path forward. going either cold turkey sort tapering limit

can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-

tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean

important understand doesn't just go back level before,

counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?

great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can

can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

capable of, feel. want guard want understand
them. lean understanding dopamine. talk
tools can use leverage dopamine order keep baseline
appropriate, healthy place, still able access peaks dopamine.

00:36:58 Tool 3 Controlling Dopamine Peaks & Baselines

those, makes life rich worth living. talk
baseline dopamine peaks dopamine
can achieve different activities things ingest. us different
baseline levels dopamine. sure genetic. people just simply
ride level little bit higher. little bit excited, little bit
motivated, maybe lot excited lot motivated. people
little mellower, people little less excitable.
fact dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine close cousins friends
nervous system. just name off close cousins friends.
Epinephrin also called adrenaline main chemical driver energy. can't
anything, anything all, unless level epinephrin brain body.
released adrenal glands right top kidneys. released
area brainstem called locus coeruleus. release tends wake neural
circuits brain wake various aspects body's physiology give us
readiness. come no surprise dopamine epinephrin aka
adrenaline hang together. fact, epinephrin adrenaline actually
manufactured dopamine. biochemical pathway involving dopamine
beautiful pathway. ever want look up, can just look biochemistry
dopamine. find that, l-DOPA converted dopamine. Dopamine
converted two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, also called. noredrenaline,
norepinephrin converted adrenaline. not dopamine epinephrin
aka adrenaline close cousins, actually family members. Okay? closely
related. not going get deep epinephrin today. not going talk
much pathways, anytime talking dopaminergic transmission
peak dopamine, inevitably, means peak
release epinephrin well. dopamine dopamine really colors
subjective experience activity make pleasureful, make something


want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean
that. say not alive now, alive 10,000 years ago.
woke looked realized minimal water
minimal food left. Maybe child, maybe partner, maybe
entire village, realize need things. Okay? need able
generate energy go seek things. chances dangers
seeking things. Yes, saber-tooth tigers things sort,
dangers too. danger cut skin lead
infection. danger storms, danger cold, danger
leaving loved ones behind. go forage, right? hunting,
gathering, both. going foraging process
certain driven dopamine. mean, no fossil record brain,
circuits existed. know tens thousands, not hundreds thousands

reward. great. needs return lower level. Why? Well,
just stayed there, never continue forage more. doesn't
just increase baseline stay there. goes back down.
important understand doesn't just go back level before,
goes level went seeking thing. Now,
counter-intuitive. often think, Oh, okay, going pursue win, right?
move modern day. going run marathon, going train
marathon. run marathon finish, cross finish line, feel
great. think, okay, now set entire year, going feel
much better, going feel accomplishment body, going great.
not happens. might feel things, level
dopamine actually dropped baseline. Now, eventually will ratchet back up.


two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop
baseline. anyone experienced real drop baseline addictive
tendencies, whether not behaviors substances, always going
path forward. going either cold turkey sort tapering limit

gambler doesn't appeal you, imagine something
appeals you, something repeatedly enjoy it. almost
inevitably intermittent schedule. intermittent schedule
dopamine sometimes arrives, sometimes little bit, sometimes lot,
sometimes medium amount. Okay? intermittent reinforcement schedule
actually best schedule export activities. that? Well, first
all, engaged activities school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
experience win, careful allowing experience huge
peaks dopamine, unless willing suffer crash follows waiting
period time come back up. look like practical sense?
Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-
workout drink taking energy drink listening favorite music.
gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine
release, getting big peak dopamine, actually increasing number
conditions required achieve pleasure activity again. form
sometimes things love get optimal workout.
listen favorite music, got favorite time day, pre-
workout drink, thing. things give best experience
workout you. also version sometimes don't
dopamine enhancing activities. don't ingest anything increase dopamine.
just exercise. don't exercise expect dopamine arrive
call exogenous source well. might think, well, sounds
lame. want continue enjoy exercising. Ah, well, exactly point. want
maintain motivation school, exercise, relationships pursuits duration
kind, key thing make sure peak dopamine, high, doesn't
occur often. something occur often vary much
dopamine experience engagement activity. Now, activities
naturally intermittent property woven them, right? sometimes

achieve those, start modulating somewhat random. might
removing dopamine releasing chemicals might take prior.


Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,
sometimes thing, alone. lot different ways this.
lot different ways approach this, now knowing know
peaks baselines dopamine understanding important not just
achieve peaks, maintain baseline healthy level,
straightforward implement intermittent schedules.
begging specificity, can give tool. One be, can flip
coin engaging types activities decide whether not
going allow dopamine supportive elements go instance, gym
you. going listen music not? enjoy listening music, well
flip coin, comes heads, bring music in, comes tails, don't.
Okay? sounds like undercutting progress, actually serving
progress

something think misinterpreted people can't alone now. People
talk about, oh, know, can't walk across street can't go anywhere,
ride bus, can't plane without contact. can't handle just
thoughts. don't think really going on. think happened

baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

want of. Epinephrin energy. Epinephrin alone can fear,
paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, mental paralysis, know, frozen fear
traumatized scared. addition dopamine chemical cocktail,
dopamine released brain, well, epinephrin becomes one excitement.
Okay? using broad brush here, essentially need know that,
dopamine epinephrin aka adrenaline family members.

00:40:06 Chocolate, Sex (Pursuit & Behavior), Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine,
Exercise

tend work together like little gang make seek certain things.
sorts activities? sorts things increase dopamine? much
increase dopamine? Well, take look typical things people
ingest known increase dopamine. recall
baseline level dopamine everybody does. even within family,
might family members excitable, happy motivated,
others less excitable, happy motivated. level dopamine
everything genetics, also experienced
previous days previous months on. ingest certain things,
levels dopamine will rise baseline transiently. depending
ingest, will rise either less, will brief last long time.
take look typical things people take eat.
good us, not good us. ask much dopamine
increased baseline? Now, course, averages, averages
measured so-called micro dialysis studies animals. actually
extracting particular brain areas much dopamine released?
measuring serum, circulating levels dopamine humans. Chocolate.
didn't look milk versus dark chocolate. chocolate will increase baseline level
dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? pretty substantial increase dopamine.
transient. goes away minutes even seconds. explain
determines duration minute. 1.5 times chocolate. Sex. pursuit
sex act sex increases dopamine two times. doubling baseline.
Now, course, going variation there, average increase
baseline dopamine caused sex. Later, will talk different aspects


so-called arousal art, different aspects sex, believe not differential
impact dopamine. now general theme activity, sex doubles amount
dopamine circulating blood. Nicotine. particular, nicotine smoked like
cigarettes forth, increases dopamine two half times baseline.
peak goes baseline two half times higher. short-
lived. Anyone ever chain smoker observed chain smoker understands
increase dopamine nicotine short-lived. Cocaine will increase
level dopamine bloodstream two half times baseline.
amphetamine another drug increases dopamine will increase amount
dopamine bloodstream 10 times baseline. tremendous increase
dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will different impact levels
dopamine, depending much somebody subjectively enjoys exercise.
somebody loves running, chances going increase levels
dopamine two times baseline, not unlike sex. People dislike exercise
will achieve less dopamine increase no increase dopamine exercise.
like forms exercise like yoga weightlifting swimming you.
Again, going vary subjective experience whether not enjoy
activity. important. brings us back something talked
earlier. Remember mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, cortical part important.
cortical part actually specific part, prefrontal cortex.
area forebrain involved thinking planning involved assigning
rational explanation something, involved assigning subjective experience
something, right? instance, pen holding right now, one
Pilot V5s. love Pilot V5s. don't sponsor podcast. just happen like
them. liked way write, feel. spent enough time thinking
it, talking it, probably get dopamine increase just talking
Pilot V5. not propensity release dopamine easily,
start engage something say it,
encourage think it, profound impact rewarding
non rewarding properties. Now, not simply case can lie yourself,
can tell love something don't really love it, will
increase dopamine. found again, people journal
something practice form appreciation something, think
aspect something enjoy, amount dopamine behavior


will evoke tends go up. people hate exercise, can think
aspect exercise really enjoy. However, will caution saying
yourself, hate exercise hate studying hate person, love reward
give afterward. Later, going talk rewards given afterward
actually make situation worse. won't make like exercise study
more, actually will undermine dopamine release otherwise occur
activity. certain things chemicals universal effect. make everybody's
dopamine go up. people like chocolate, people don't course,
general, make causes increase dopamine. sex, nicotine, cocaine,
amphetamine, things cause increases dopamine everybody takes
them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working challenge
relationship working something hard kind going subjective

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience
workout. Sometimes also perform better well, course, talk
minutes, aspect approach rather trying just get
dopamine high possibly can, order get experience, turns
not best approach. find talk dopamine
schedules layering together multiple things, substances activities lead
big increases dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues motivation
energy right experiences even couple days later. not saying
people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find
capacity release dopamine

00:49:54 Pursuit, Excitement & “Dopamine Setpoint”

level motivation drive energy overall will take serious hit. Now,
alluding dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since
beginning episode. talked tonic phasic release forth. now
really drill means, leverage purposes.
order that, take step back ask, dopamine system
like this? dopamine system all? Well, remember
species primary interest is? species like species main interest,
make itself. just sex reproduction.
forging resources. Resources can food, can water can salt, can
shelter, can social connection. Dopamine universal currency forging
seeking, right? call sometimes talk motivation craving, mean
evolutionary adaptive context, mean forging seeking. Seeking
water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things make us feel good avoiding
things don't make us feel good. particular seeking things will provide


sustenance pleasure short-term will extend species long-term.
understand dopamine driver us seek things, makes perfect
sense baseline level peaks.
baseline peaks related sort direct way. mean

talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much

eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle

Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number

kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous

drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

00:46:46 Tool 4 Caffeine Increases Dopamine Receptors

much dopamine will released. will return subjective
component little bit. now sense much dopamine can
evoked different activities different substances. One might
wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.
drink, won't name names, drink canned energy drink drink pre-
workout try get big stimulation stimulant effect dopamine,
norepinephrin, family molecules works together make motivated.
also exercise try get even dopaminergic experience

people shouldn't take occasional pre-workout thing, drink cup
coffee two working now again. people really enjoy that.
certainly every while, often, find

check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable

dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first

found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine

put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-

wondering caffeine. certainly drinking caffeine today, enjoy
caffeine limited quantities. drink yerba mate drink coffee love it.
increase dopamine? Well, little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine extent,
pretty modest compared things described. Chocolate, sex,
nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine on. However, really interesting paper
published 2015. Volkow et al. can look easy find.
showed regular ingestion caffeine, whether not coffee otherwise,
increases regulation certain dopamine receptors. caffeine actually makes
able experience dopamines effects. mentioned before,
dopamine vomited synapse released volumetrically,
bind someplace trigger G protein-coupled receptors. caffeine increases
number, density G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back
thinking that, might think, oh yeah, know, sometimes notice people,
least old days used cigarette cup coffee. people
drink alcohol, oftentimes smoke. well-known different compounds like
alcohol nicotine caffeine nicotine certain behaviors certain drugs can


synergize give bigger dopamine increases. not terribly uncommon.
lot people nowadays instance take pre-workout energy drinks.

also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine

Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,

flip coin, comes heads, bring music in, comes tails, don't.
Okay? sounds like undercutting progress, actually serving

Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend

nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting

treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop

actually best schedule export activities. that? Well, first
all, engaged activities school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
experience win, careful allowing experience huge
peaks dopamine, unless willing suffer crash follows waiting
period time come back up. look like practical sense?
Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-
workout drink taking energy drink listening favorite music.
gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine

conditions required achieve pleasure activity again. form
sometimes things love get optimal workout.
listen favorite music, got favorite time day, pre-

Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing

addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing

fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense

years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first

popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

two things really important. First all, extent drops
baseline proportional high peak was. cross finish line pretty
happy, won't drop much baseline afterward. cross finish line
ecstatic, well, day two later, going feel quite bit lower
otherwise. might not depressed, depends baseline
begin with. so-called postpartum depression people experience
giving birth big win graduation kind celebration postpartum
drop mood affect motivation drop baseline dopamine.
important understand, happens rapid timescales can last
quite long time. also explains behavior us familiar with,
engaging something really enjoy. Going restaurant absolutely
love, engaging way person really, really enjoy.
continue engage behavior again, kind loses edge. starts
kind feel less exciting us. us experienced drop excitement
quickly severely others, everyone experiences extent.
direct roots evolutionarily conserved circuits. may
hearing think, no, no, no, no not works me. just riding higher
higher time. love kids, love job, love school, love wins, don't
want losses. agree. feel good achieving things, oftentimes
feeling good layering different aspects life, consuming things
things increase dopamine. getting peaks, afterward
drop baseline occurs, always takes little get back stable
baseline. really sort dopamine set point. continue indulge
behaviors even different behaviors increase dopamine big
peaks again, won't experience level joy
behaviors anything all. Now, name. called addiction.
even people aren't addicted, even people don't attachment specific
substance behavior, drop bay baseline peak dopamine
substantial. governs whether not going feel motivated continue
pursue things. Fortunately, way work this, can
constantly stay motivated,

00:56:46 Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”



also keep baseline dopamine appropriate, healthy level. previous
guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna Lembke. head Addiction
Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford. amazing book, "Dopamine Nation: Finding
Balance Age Indulgence". haven't read book, highly encourage
check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,
types behaviors. books really focus dopamine schedules
relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe

lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things

can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly

Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work

Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people

people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

check out. fantastic. terrific book dopamine "Molecule
More", similar regard, isn't much addiction,

relationship peaks baselines dopamine. Dr. Lembke's
book, Huberman Lab Podcast podcasts,
talked pleasure pain balance seek something really like,
indulge it, like eating little piece chocolate, really liked chocolate,
pleasure. little bit pain exceeds amount
pleasure, subtle, experience wanting thing. Okay?
pleasure pain balance, telling pleasure pain
governed dopamine extent. Well, be? Right? said before,
engage activity ingest something increases dopamine,
dopamine levels go up, know, substantial degree things listed off.
pain coming from? Well, pain coming lack dopamine
follows. now know lack dopamine reflects. know? Well,
earlier talking dopamine released neurons.
mentioned two ways. One, synapse can activate postsynaptic
neuron. called volumetric release distributed
broadly. released bunch neurons. cases released
things call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles contain
dopamine. Prrr! get vomited area synapse. Well,
vesicles get depleted. synaptic physiologists there, call readily
releasable pool dopamine. can deploy dopamine ready
deployed. packaged little vesicles ready go. like
order product say stock two months now. Well, not ready
released. thing dopamine. pool dopamine synthesized,
can release dopamine synthesized. readily
releasable pool. pleasure pain balance doesn't hinge readily releasable
pool dopamine, big part pleasure pain balance hinges much
dopamine there? much ready capable released


system? now given meat thing call pleasure pain
balance, now make perfect sense take something
something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine

Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,

flip coin, comes heads, bring music in, comes tails, don't.
Okay? sounds like undercutting progress, actually serving

baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

something leads huge increases dopamine,

01:00:00 Addiction, Dopamine Depletion, & Replenishing Dopamine

afterward baseline drop isn't lot dopamine around
keep baseline going. Fortunately, people not experience pursue
enormous increases dopamine leading severe drops baseline. Many people
do, however, call addiction. somebody pursues drug
activity leads huge increases dopamine. now understand
afterward baseline dopamine drops depletion dopamine, readily
releasable pool. dopamine literally not around released, people feel
pretty lousy many people make mistake going pursuing
dopamine evoking dopamine releasing activity substance thinking
mistakenly going bring baseline. going give peak
again. Not not give peak, baseline gets lower lower
depleting dopamine more. seen
people get addicted something not achieving much
pleasure all. can even see video games. People will play video game,
love it, super exciting them, keep playing playing
playing, either one two things happens typically both. First all, always say
addiction progressive narrowing things bring pleasure. oftentimes
will happen person excitement can achieve dopamine release
extent behavior not behaviors. start losing
interest school, start losing interest relationships. start losing interest
fitness wellbeing depletes life. eventually typically happens is,
will stop getting dopamine release activity well, drop
pretty serious depression can get severe people committed
suicide sorts patterns activity. typical scenario?
scenario somebody really good working week,
exercise week, drink weekends? Well, person
consuming alcohol maybe one two nights week, oftentimes person
will spiking dopamine food middle week. Now,


eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop
baseline. anyone experienced real drop baseline addictive
tendencies, whether not behaviors substances, always going
path forward. going either cold turkey sort tapering limit

Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-

Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,

activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way

eat nice eat foods enjoy. certainly that. love food fact.
say eating foods really evoke lot dopamine release middle
week, drinking one two days weekend, one work,
hard play hard type. swimming couple miles ocean middle
week well. going dancing weekend. Sounds like pretty
balanced life describe it. Well, problem. problem dopamine
not just evoked one activities, dopamine evoked activities.
dopamine one currency craving motivation desire pleasure.
one currency. even though look activities, say, well, just
weekends thing couple times week. looked dopamine
simply function, chemical function peaks baseline, might make sense
person several years work hard, play hard say, yeah, know
feeling kind burnt out. just not feeling like energy
years ago. course age-related reasons people can experience
drops energy, oftentimes happening not sort depletion cellar
metabolism related aging. happening spiking dopamine
many different activities throughout week, baseline
progressively dropping. case can subtle. can very, subtle.
actually sinister function dopamine say. can
often drop imperceptible ways, reaches threshold low
dopamine, just feel like, hmm, can't really get pleasure anything anymore.
used work doesn't work anymore. starts look lot like severe
addictions acute addictions things like cocaine amphetamine
lead big increases, big spikes dopamine, severe
drops baseline. Now, course, engage activities enjoy.
certainly do, everybody should. huge part life pursuing activities things
enjoy. key thing understand relationship peaks
baseline, understand influence one another. that,
can start make really good choices short run long run maintain
level dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise level dopamine baseline
still get peaks still achieve feelings elevated motivation, elevated
desire craving. again, peaks sufficiently healthy high
level dopamine baseline drove evolution species,
really drive evolution anyone's life progression too. good thing.


Dopamine good thing. Just briefly, also covered interview
episode Anna Lembke addiction. might asking,
experience drop baseline level dopamine
engagement activity substance led big peaks? Just put
color example this, episodes ago talked friend
known long time. actually child friend basically become addicted
video games, decided actually seeing episode Anna 30-day
complete fast phone, video games social media kinds.
now day 29 really accomplished this, not incidentally, levels concentration,
overall mood up. far far better. hard. particular first
14 days really hard, way replenish releasable pool dopamine
not engage dopaminergic seeking behaviors. remember typically
people arrive place want stop engaging behaviors
ingesting substances dopamine depleted, not getting
lift. case, feeling depressed. thought ADHD. starting
treat ADHD. certainly people ADHD,
found levels concentration back. not need treated
ADHD. actually psychiatrist wondered prior video game,
social media fast. feeling good. exercising again. not making up.
really specific, relevant example dopamine system can
replenish itself. course, clinical need ADHD treatment, means
pursue that. think lot ADHD go misdiagnosed depletion
dopamine occurs overindulgence activities drop

gambler doesn't appeal you, imagine something
appeals you, something repeatedly enjoy it. almost
inevitably intermittent schedule. intermittent schedule
dopamine sometimes arrives, sometimes little bit, sometimes lot,
sometimes medium amount. Okay? intermittent reinforcement schedule
actually best schedule export activities. that? Well, first
all, engaged activities school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
experience win, careful allowing experience huge
peaks dopamine, unless willing suffer crash follows waiting
period time come back up. look like practical sense?
Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-
workout drink taking energy drink listening favorite music.
gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine
release, getting big peak dopamine, actually increasing number
conditions required achieve pleasure activity again. form
sometimes things love get optimal workout.
listen favorite music, got favorite time day, pre-
workout drink, thing. things give best experience
workout you. also version sometimes don't
dopamine enhancing activities. don't ingest anything increase dopamine.
just exercise. don't exercise expect dopamine arrive
call exogenous source well. might think, well, sounds
lame. want continue enjoy exercising. Ah, well, exactly point. want
maintain motivation school, exercise, relationships pursuits duration
kind, key thing make sure peak dopamine, high, doesn't
occur often. something occur often vary much
dopamine experience engagement activity. Now, activities
naturally intermittent property woven them, right? sometimes
classes like classes don't like. don't always get straight A's,
sometimes don't get rewarded outcome like. don't always
perfect relationship outcome, understand ability experience
motivation pleasure comes next dictated much motivation
pleasure dopamine experienced prior. reason can't give specific

specific schedule dopamine going high, dopamine going
low dopamine going medium. predictable schedule, not
random intermittent schedule. like casinos certainly works
activities like continue engage time, whatever happen

achieve those, start modulating somewhat random. might
removing dopamine releasing chemicals might take prior.


Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,
sometimes thing, alone. lot different ways this.
lot different ways approach this, now knowing know
peaks baselines dopamine understanding important not just
achieve peaks, maintain baseline healthy level,
straightforward implement intermittent schedules.
begging specificity, can give tool. One be, can flip
coin engaging types activities decide whether not
going allow dopamine supportive elements go instance, gym
you. going listen music not? enjoy listening music, well
flip coin, comes heads, bring music in, comes tails, don't.
Okay? sounds like undercutting progress, actually serving
progress

taking,



01:19:45 Stimulants & Spiking Dopamine: Counterproductive Work, Exercise &
Attention

layering sources dopamine dropping baseline.
reason, caution people using stimulants every time study
every time work every time anything like
continue enjoy motivated at. one exception caffeine,
mentioned before, like caffeine, actually good thing
dopamine system, upregulate D2, D3 receptors. actually
makes whatever dopamine released activity, accessible
functional within biochemistry pathways brain body. However,
number energy drinks particular pre-workouts contain things precursors
dopamine, own, even didn't engage activity cause

pre-workout drinks, drugs various kinds people take study pay attention.
talked ADHD episode, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
armodafinil modafinil taken repeatedly time will reduce level satisfaction
joy get activities engage influence
compounds. not trying demonize compounds clinical use.
saying taking stimulants engaging activities like continue
feel pleasureful undercutting process. inevitably might not happen
tomorrow, might not happen month, inevitably will challenges
motivation drive related activities. Now, people can keep right
check. can just one can energy drink pre-
workout really hard days, instance. power you. actually
sometimes, frankly. people trying get peak super motivated,
driven, driven state, really focused every time engage activity,
absolutely undercutting process undermining ability stay
motivated focused. just talked intermittent reward schedules
moment ago, intermittent spiking dopamine definitely way go,
chronically trying spike dopamine order enhance motivation, focus

01:22:20 Caffeine Sources Matter: Yerba Mate & Dopamine Neuron Protection

will absolutely undermine motivation focus drive long run. Ingestion
caffeine somewhat exception among examples things
mentioned avoid otherwise dopamine increasing activities.
again, caffeine can increase density efficacy dopamine
receptors. turns source caffeine also matter coffee tea
forms caffeine will effect increasing dopamine receptors. Yerba
mate something talked podcast interesting properties.
First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns
also shown neuroprotective specifically dopaminergic neurons.
Now, mention just couple studies, don't want conclude
much studies needs done. showed model

case, don't need incentive. already enjoy yerba mate principle source
caffeine, although drink coffee well. one going consume caffeine,
might consider consuming caffeine form yerba mate sake
upregulating dopamine receptors getting dopamine increase.
course, similar properties caffeine seeking. addition
that,

01:24:20 Caffeine & Neurotoxicity MDMA

yerba mate appear sort neuroprotective
particular dopamine neuron protective properties. Now, doesn't mean caffeine
always beneficial. actually one instance related dopamine caffeine
can particularly dangerous. relates MDMA so-called ecstasy. MDMA

United States. Whether not MDMA neurotoxic controversial.


Early thought neurotoxic can destroy serotonergic neurons.
papers came argued not case.
particular one early papers published science magazine claiming
MDMA neurotoxic. paper retracted. turns study
mistakenly used methamphetamine instead, methamphetamine known
neurotoxic. think data point idea MDMA might not neurotoxic,
case, caffeine shown increase toxicity MDMA receptors.
might say, "Well, be?" Well, now understand
be. Caffeine increases density efficacy dopamine receptors, D2 D3

beneficial substance one context, actually can detrimental

01:26:15 Amphetamine, Cocaine & Detrimental Rewiring Dopamine Circuits

not dangerous substance another context. Two substances greatly increase
dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds
National Academy Sciences, high tier stringent journal. First author Kolb, K-

previous episode ADHD, talked widespread use drugs like Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil armodafinil, lead large increases dopamine,
people ADHD can really improve symptoms. course lot

01:28:45 Tool 6 Stimulating Long-Lasting Increases Baseline Dopamine

much regular basis, unless valid clinical need that.
focusing lot last minutes kind darker side dopamine
getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin

useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

actually best schedule export activities. that? Well, first
all, engaged activities school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
experience win, careful allowing experience huge
peaks dopamine, unless willing suffer crash follows waiting
period time come back up. look like practical sense?
Well, say somebody really enjoy exercise, say


somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-
workout drink taking energy drink listening favorite music.
gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine
release, getting big peak dopamine, actually increasing number
conditions required achieve pleasure activity again. form
sometimes things love get optimal workout.
listen favorite music, got favorite time day, pre-

Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,

texting selfies communicating various ways, listening podcasts,
listening music, sorts things engage activities going
dinner texting people making plans, sharing information.
wonderful, gives depth richness color life, isn't just
distracted nature engaging phone, also way layering
dopamine. no surprise levels depression lack motivation really
increase. Everything talked now sets explanation
interpretation interacting digital technology can potentially lead disruptions
lowering baseline levels dopamine. can use personal example this.
happen really enjoy working out, always really enjoyed it. recent years
noticed that, bringing phone workouts, not little bit
distracted not focusing much
have, also started lose interest doing. wasn't pleasureful,
feel like just didn't kind oomph. beginning
question motivation. started learning relationship


peaks bass lines dopamine. realized time ago
probably experienced incredible increase amount dopamine one
workouts, enjoy working enjoy listening music. also enjoy
listening podcasts, also enjoy communicating people. wonderful
pursuits, layered many many times. essentially
wasn't working anymore. Much way drug wouldn't work
somebody takes repeatedly baseline dopamine dropping.

workouts all. No music, least not phone. can room.
might listen podcast room, don't listen anything engage anything
phone. No texting whatsoever. time just don't even bring
period time. short period time. not training often.
something think misinterpreted people can't alone now. People
talk about, oh, know, can't walk across street can't go anywhere,
ride bus, can't plane without contact. can't handle just
thoughts. don't think really going on. think happened
achieved great dopamine increase comes incredible thing
personally enjoy able communicate phone, text exchange pictures

doesn't fulfilling aspect it. tends remove excitement
pleasure activities engaged in. know hard one
many people, invite try removing multiple sources dopamine

want continue enjoy, want enjoy more. now understand
biological mechanisms underlie statement like that. takes little bit
working with, know can challenging first week not engaging
phone kind workout. actually really tough, now back
place enjoy much more. also feel conquered something terms
circuitry related dopamine. now understand something enjoyed
much become less pleasureful me. deep, deep satisfaction
comes understanding, okay, wasn't anything wrong
anything all. just something wrong approach
taking,



01:19:45 Stimulants & Spiking Dopamine: Counterproductive Work, Exercise &
Attention

layering sources dopamine dropping baseline.
reason, caution people using stimulants every time study
every time work every time anything like
continue enjoy motivated at. one exception caffeine,
mentioned before, like caffeine, actually good thing
dopamine system, upregulate D2, D3 receptors. actually
makes whatever dopamine released activity, accessible
functional within biochemistry pathways brain body. However,
number energy drinks particular pre-workouts contain things precursors
dopamine, own, even didn't engage activity cause
release dopamine substantial degree. cause release dopamine
substantial degree. time will deplete dopamine. energy drinks,
pre-workout drinks, drugs various kinds people take study pay attention.
talked ADHD episode, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
armodafinil modafinil taken repeatedly time will reduce level satisfaction
joy get activities engage influence
compounds. not trying demonize compounds clinical use.
saying taking stimulants engaging activities like continue
feel pleasureful undercutting process. inevitably might not happen
tomorrow, might not happen month, inevitably will challenges
motivation drive related activities. Now, people can keep right
check. can just one can energy drink pre-
workout really hard days, instance. power you. actually
sometimes, frankly. people trying get peak super motivated,
driven, driven state, really focused every time engage activity,
absolutely undercutting process undermining ability stay
motivated focused. just talked intermittent reward schedules
moment ago, intermittent spiking dopamine definitely way go,
chronically trying spike dopamine order enhance motivation, focus
drive



01:22:20 Caffeine Sources Matter: Yerba Mate & Dopamine Neuron Protection

will absolutely undermine motivation focus drive long run. Ingestion
caffeine somewhat exception among examples things
mentioned avoid otherwise dopamine increasing activities.
again, caffeine can increase density efficacy dopamine
receptors. turns source caffeine also matter coffee tea
forms caffeine will effect increasing dopamine receptors. Yerba
mate something talked podcast interesting properties.
First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns
also shown neuroprotective specifically dopaminergic neurons.
Now, mention just couple studies, don't want conclude
much studies needs done. showed model
damage dopamine neurons, ingestion yerba mate, compounds
within yerba mate can actually serve preserve survival dopamine neurons
movement related pathway motivation pathway. perhaps need
incentive order ingest yerba mate, perhaps don't need incentive.
case, don't need incentive. already enjoy yerba mate principle source
caffeine, although drink coffee well. one going consume caffeine,
might consider consuming caffeine form yerba mate sake
upregulating dopamine receptors getting dopamine increase.
course, similar properties caffeine seeking. addition
that,

01:24:20 Caffeine & Neurotoxicity MDMA

yerba mate appear sort neuroprotective
particular dopamine neuron protective properties. Now, doesn't mean caffeine
always beneficial. actually one instance related dopamine caffeine
can particularly dangerous. relates MDMA so-called ecstasy. MDMA
investigation various clinical trials potential treat trauma
depression. also course, drug used recreationally. still illegal least
United States. Whether not MDMA neurotoxic controversial.


Early thought neurotoxic can destroy serotonergic neurons.
papers came argued not case.
particular one early papers published science magazine claiming
MDMA neurotoxic. paper retracted. turns study
mistakenly used methamphetamine instead, methamphetamine known
neurotoxic. think data point idea MDMA might not neurotoxic,
case, caffeine shown increase toxicity MDMA receptors.
might say, "Well, be?" Well, now understand
be. Caffeine increases density efficacy dopamine receptors, D2 D3
receptors. MDMA potent drug increasing concentrations dopamine well
serotonin neuromodulators. appears caffeine ingestion
upregulating receptors, can lead toxicity MDMA. caffeine can
beneficial substance one context, actually can detrimental

01:26:15 Amphetamine, Cocaine & Detrimental Rewiring Dopamine Circuits

not dangerous substance another context. Two substances greatly increase
dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds
National Academy Sciences, high tier stringent journal. First author Kolb, K-
O-L-B. title paper pretty much tells story. Amphetamine cocaine

previous episode ADHD, talked widespread use drugs like Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil armodafinil, lead large increases dopamine,
people ADHD can really improve symptoms. course lot
non-prescription, non-clinical use compounds well. stands reason
use substances increase dopamine well provide
sort blockade neuroplasticity cocaine amphetamine do.
look amount dopamine increase triggered compounds, really
comparable. again, cautionary note spiking one's dopamine

01:28:45 Tool 6 Stimulating Long-Lasting Increases Baseline Dopamine

much regular basis, unless valid clinical need that.
focusing lot last minutes kind darker side dopamine
getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

somebody kind likes exercise, forces it, make
pleasureful giving favorite cup coffee first, maybe taking pre-
workout drink taking energy drink listening favorite music.
gym listening music. sounds great, right? Well,
great except layering together things try achieve dopamine
release, getting big peak dopamine, actually increasing number
conditions required achieve pleasure activity again. form
sometimes things love get optimal workout.
listen favorite music, got favorite time day, pre-
workout drink, thing. things give best experience
workout you. also version sometimes don't
dopamine enhancing activities. don't ingest anything increase dopamine.
just exercise. don't exercise expect dopamine arrive
call exogenous source well. might think, well, sounds
lame. want continue enjoy exercising. Ah, well, exactly point. want
maintain motivation school, exercise, relationships pursuits duration
kind, key thing make sure peak dopamine, high, doesn't
occur often. something occur often vary much
dopamine experience engagement activity. Now, activities
naturally intermittent property woven them, right? sometimes
classes like classes don't like. don't always get straight A's,
sometimes don't get rewarded outcome like. don't always
perfect relationship outcome, understand ability experience
motivation pleasure comes next dictated much motivation
pleasure dopamine experienced prior. reason can't give specific
protocol like delete dopamine lower dopamine every third time, wouldn't
intermittent. whole basis intermittent reinforcement don't really
specific schedule dopamine going high, dopamine going
low dopamine going medium. predictable schedule, not
random intermittent schedule. like casinos certainly works
activities like continue engage time, whatever happen
be. Start paying attention amount dopamine excitement pleasure
achieve those, start modulating somewhat random. might
removing dopamine releasing chemicals might take prior.


Maybe remove every time, every introduce them,.
Maybe involves sometimes things socially enjoy socially,
sometimes thing, alone. lot different ways this.
lot different ways approach this, now knowing know
peaks baselines dopamine understanding important not just
achieve peaks, maintain baseline healthy level,
straightforward implement intermittent schedules.
begging specificity, can give tool. One be, can flip
coin engaging types activities decide whether not
going allow dopamine supportive elements go instance, gym
you. going listen music not? enjoy listening music, well
flip coin, comes heads, bring music in, comes tails, don't.
Okay? sounds like undercutting progress, actually serving
progress

01:15:28 Smart Phones: Alter Dopamine Circuits

short-term long-term that. Now, smartphone interesting
tool dopamine light this. extremely common nowadays see people
texting selfies communicating various ways, listening podcasts,
listening music, sorts things engage activities going
dinner texting people making plans, sharing information.
wonderful, gives depth richness color life, isn't just
distracted nature engaging phone, also way layering
dopamine. no surprise levels depression lack motivation really
increase. Everything talked now sets explanation
interpretation interacting digital technology can potentially lead disruptions
lowering baseline levels dopamine. can use personal example this.
happen really enjoy working out, always really enjoyed it. recent years
noticed that, bringing phone workouts, not little bit
distracted not focusing much
have, also started lose interest doing. wasn't pleasureful,
feel like just didn't kind oomph. beginning
question motivation. started learning relationship


peaks bass lines dopamine. realized time ago
probably experienced incredible increase amount dopamine one
workouts, enjoy working enjoy listening music. also enjoy
listening podcasts, also enjoy communicating people. wonderful
pursuits, layered many many times. essentially
wasn't working anymore. Much way drug wouldn't work
somebody takes repeatedly baseline dopamine dropping.
least calendar year, made rule myself, don't allow phone
workouts all. No music, least not phone. can room.
might listen podcast room, don't listen anything engage anything
phone. No texting whatsoever. time just don't even bring
period time. short period time. not training often.
something think misinterpreted people can't alone now. People
talk about, oh, know, can't walk across street can't go anywhere,
ride bus, can't plane without contact. can't handle just
thoughts. don't think really going on. think happened
achieved great dopamine increase comes incredible thing
personally enjoy able communicate phone, text exchange pictures
send links kinds things, social media. happens
doesn't fulfilling aspect it. tends remove excitement
pleasure activities engaged in. know hard one
many people, invite try removing multiple sources dopamine
release used multiple sources dopamine release activities
want continue enjoy, want enjoy more. now understand
biological mechanisms underlie statement like that. takes little bit
working with, know can challenging first week not engaging
phone kind workout. actually really tough, now back
place enjoy much more. also feel conquered something terms
circuitry related dopamine. now understand something enjoyed
much become less pleasureful me. deep, deep satisfaction
comes understanding, okay, wasn't anything wrong

can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

01:22:20 Caffeine Sources Matter: Yerba Mate & Dopamine Neuron Protection

will absolutely undermine motivation focus drive long run. Ingestion
caffeine somewhat exception among examples things
mentioned avoid otherwise dopamine increasing activities.
again, caffeine can increase density efficacy dopamine

forms caffeine will effect increasing dopamine receptors. Yerba
mate something talked podcast interesting properties.
First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns

dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

01:22:20 Caffeine Sources Matter: Yerba Mate & Dopamine Neuron Protection

will absolutely undermine motivation focus drive long run. Ingestion
caffeine somewhat exception among examples things
mentioned avoid otherwise dopamine increasing activities.
again, caffeine can increase density efficacy dopamine

forms caffeine will effect increasing dopamine receptors. Yerba
mate something talked podcast interesting properties.
First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns

dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds

today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

01:22:20 Caffeine Sources Matter: Yerba Mate & Dopamine Neuron Protection

will absolutely undermine motivation focus drive long run. Ingestion
caffeine somewhat exception among examples things
mentioned avoid otherwise dopamine increasing activities.
again, caffeine can increase density efficacy dopamine
receptors. turns source caffeine also matter coffee tea
forms caffeine will effect increasing dopamine receptors. Yerba
mate something talked podcast interesting properties.
First all, contains caffeine. also high antioxidants. also contains something
called GLP-1 favorable management blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns
also shown neuroprotective specifically dopaminergic neurons.
Now, mention just couple studies, don't want conclude
much studies needs done. showed model
damage dopamine neurons, ingestion yerba mate, compounds
within yerba mate can actually serve preserve survival dopamine neurons
movement related pathway motivation pathway. perhaps need
incentive order ingest yerba mate, perhaps don't need incentive.
case, don't need incentive. already enjoy yerba mate principle source
caffeine, although drink coffee well. one going consume caffeine,
might consider consuming caffeine form yerba mate sake
upregulating dopamine receptors getting dopamine increase.
course, similar properties caffeine seeking. addition
that,

01:24:20 Caffeine & Neurotoxicity MDMA

yerba mate appear sort neuroprotective
particular dopamine neuron protective properties. Now, doesn't mean caffeine
always beneficial. actually one instance related dopamine caffeine
can particularly dangerous. relates MDMA so-called ecstasy. MDMA
investigation various clinical trials potential treat trauma
depression. also course, drug used recreationally. still illegal least
United States. Whether not MDMA neurotoxic controversial.


Early thought neurotoxic can destroy serotonergic neurons.
papers came argued not case.
particular one early papers published science magazine claiming
MDMA neurotoxic. paper retracted. turns study
mistakenly used methamphetamine instead, methamphetamine known
neurotoxic. think data point idea MDMA might not neurotoxic,
case, caffeine shown increase toxicity MDMA receptors.
might say, "Well, be?" Well, now understand
be. Caffeine increases density efficacy dopamine receptors, D2 D3
receptors. MDMA potent drug increasing concentrations dopamine well
serotonin neuromodulators. appears caffeine ingestion
upregulating receptors, can lead toxicity MDMA. caffeine can
beneficial substance one context, actually can detrimental

01:26:15 Amphetamine, Cocaine & Detrimental Rewiring Dopamine Circuits

not dangerous substance another context. Two substances greatly increase
dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds
National Academy Sciences, high tier stringent journal. First author Kolb, K-
O-L-B. title paper pretty much tells story. Amphetamine cocaine
limits ability later experience promote structural plasticity neocortex
nucleus accumbens. Neocortex outer shell brain less.
nucleus accumbens part that, mesolimbic dopamine pathway motivation drive
reinforcement. Neuroplasticity course, brain's ability change response
experience. neuroplasticity basis learning memory essentially
remodeling neural circuitry positive ways kinds. study really
one first show ingesting amphetamine cocaine high
peak dopamine creates low dopamine state, baseline drop
creates afterwards, limits plasticity learning subsequent taking amphetamine
cocaine. least study shown long lasting effect. doubt
permanent effect, serve serious cautionary note amphetamine
cocaine not can cause drop baseline dopamine, can actually put


brain state

01:27:57 Ritalin, Adderall, (Ar)Modafinil: ADHD versus non-Prescription Uses

cannot learn modify get better least period time.
previous episode ADHD, talked widespread use drugs like Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil armodafinil, lead large increases dopamine,
people ADHD can really improve symptoms. course lot
non-prescription, non-clinical use compounds well. stands reason
use substances increase dopamine well provide
sort blockade neuroplasticity cocaine amphetamine do.
look amount dopamine increase triggered compounds, really
comparable. again, cautionary note spiking one's dopamine

01:28:45 Tool 6 Stimulating Long-Lasting Increases Baseline Dopamine

much regular basis, unless valid clinical need that.
focusing lot last minutes kind darker side dopamine
getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

Early thought neurotoxic can destroy serotonergic neurons.
papers came argued not case.
particular one early papers published science magazine claiming
MDMA neurotoxic. paper retracted. turns study
mistakenly used methamphetamine instead, methamphetamine known
neurotoxic. think data point idea MDMA might not neurotoxic,
case, caffeine shown increase toxicity MDMA receptors.
might say, "Well, be?" Well, now understand
be. Caffeine increases density efficacy dopamine receptors, D2 D3
receptors. MDMA potent drug increasing concentrations dopamine well
serotonin neuromodulators. appears caffeine ingestion
upregulating receptors, can lead toxicity MDMA. caffeine can
beneficial substance one context, actually can detrimental

01:26:15 Amphetamine, Cocaine & Detrimental Rewiring Dopamine Circuits

not dangerous substance another context. Two substances greatly increase
dopamine, namely amphetamine cocaine can cause long-term problems
dopaminergic pathways. largely based study published
years ago, 2003, still holds lot merit. paper published proceeds
National Academy Sciences, high tier stringent journal. First author Kolb, K-
O-L-B. title paper pretty much tells story. Amphetamine cocaine
limits ability later experience promote structural plasticity neocortex
nucleus accumbens. Neocortex outer shell brain less.
nucleus accumbens part that, mesolimbic dopamine pathway motivation drive
reinforcement. Neuroplasticity course, brain's ability change response
experience. neuroplasticity basis learning memory essentially
remodeling neural circuitry positive ways kinds. study really
one first show ingesting amphetamine cocaine high
peak dopamine creates low dopamine state, baseline drop
creates afterwards, limits plasticity learning subsequent taking amphetamine
cocaine. least study shown long lasting effect. doubt
permanent effect, serve serious cautionary note amphetamine
cocaine not can cause drop baseline dopamine, can actually put


brain state

01:27:57 Ritalin, Adderall, (Ar)Modafinil: ADHD versus non-Prescription Uses

cannot learn modify get better least period time.
previous episode ADHD, talked widespread use drugs like Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil armodafinil, lead large increases dopamine,
people ADHD can really improve symptoms. course lot
non-prescription, non-clinical use compounds well. stands reason
use substances increase dopamine well provide
sort blockade neuroplasticity cocaine amphetamine do.
look amount dopamine increase triggered compounds, really
comparable. again, cautionary note spiking one's dopamine

01:28:45 Tool 6 Stimulating Long-Lasting Increases Baseline Dopamine

much regular basis, unless valid clinical need that.
focusing lot last minutes kind darker side dopamine
getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

brain state

01:27:57 Ritalin, Adderall, (Ar)Modafinil: ADHD versus non-Prescription Uses

cannot learn modify get better least period time.
previous episode ADHD, talked widespread use drugs like Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil armodafinil, lead large increases dopamine,
people ADHD can really improve symptoms. course lot
non-prescription, non-clinical use compounds well. stands reason
use substances increase dopamine well provide
sort blockade neuroplasticity cocaine amphetamine do.
look amount dopamine increase triggered compounds, really
comparable. again, cautionary note spiking one's dopamine

01:28:45 Tool 6 Stimulating Long-Lasting Increases Baseline Dopamine

much regular basis, unless valid clinical need that.
focusing lot last minutes kind darker side dopamine
getting big peaks dopamine can detrimental, want acknowledge
truth, dopamine feels great. pursuit motivated craving
things feels wonderful. don't want demonize dopamine. trying
today illustrate dopamine works brain can continue
engage dopamine evoking activities. certainly place ingesting things
can increase dopamine provided safe us short long-term.
activities can will give us healthy, sustained increases
dopamine, peaks happen maintain even increase
baseline levels dopamine. that? activities?
Well, recent years, trend toward people so-called cold
exposure. part, popularized Wim Hof, so-called 'Iceman' getting
cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself cold water various kinds can
fact increase levels dopamine well neuromodulator norepinephrine.
not new phenomenon. 1920s, guy name Vincent Priessnitz
one first people popularize formalize cold water therapies.
advocate cold water exposure order boost immune system increase


feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

feelings wellbeing. actually practice dates back long Vincent's
popularized it. Wim Hof recent iteration this. First all,
safety parameters. establish first. Getting very, cold water. know,
30 degree Fahrenheit even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody state
cold water shock. mean, people can die that. obviously want
approach caution, people getting 60 degree water 50
degree water, acclimated comfortable it, know, 40 degree water
45 degree water can tremendously beneficial results neuromodulator
systems, including dopamine. temperature water can tolerate will depend
cold water adapted are, familiar experience
getting cold water. say comfortable with, mention, never
case getting cold water not evoke release epinephrin.
quickening breath, widening eyes, feeling can't catch
breath even physical pain level skin happens almost every
time, every time get cold water, even cold water adapted.
almost everybody knows understands that, wall, like refer
coming. always first experience getting cold water. no real way
around that. Now, study mentioned earlier, human physiological responses
immersion water different temperatures, really interesting study done
published university of, excuse me, European Journal Applied
Physiology. can provide link study show caption. really interesting
study. looked people getting exposed water warm, moderately cold
cold. 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, 14 degrees Celsius.
can just put online conversion, can conversion
Fahrenheit like. case, looked concentrations
things like epinephrin dopamine on. found really
interesting. First all, upon getting cold water, changes adrenaline
noradrenaline, epinephrin norepinephrine immediate fast,
huge increases. getting cold water everybody experiences
huge increases adrenaline. interesting observed
dopamine levels started rise somewhat slowly continued rise reach
levels high 2.5 times baseline. remarkably high increase.
Remember go back examples chocolate, sex, doubling baseline,
nicotine two half times baseline, cocaine. increase dopamine


cold water exposure kind comparable one sees cocaine, except,
except case, wasn't rise crash. actually sustained rise
dopamine took long time three hours come back baseline.
really remarkable, think explains positive, mental
physical effects people report subjectively cold water exposure. One
question many probably asking just cold water be?
Well, mimic done study 14 degrees Celsius.
people won't cold enough, people will cold.
look release stress hormones like cortisol addition release things like
epinephrin adrenaline. interesting noted cases,
especially coldest temperature, increase cortisol,
transient, eventually people's cortisol, stress hormone subsided bit.
basically two different approaches remaining cold uncomfortable. One
try relax yourself. Two, try practice slow breathing, try dilate
gaze. talked previous podcasts, go panoramic vision
essentially try calm not stressful cold. people
however, take approach trying ramp level internal autonomic arousal,
meaning get really energized kind lean friction cold.
find easier. people distract themselves, recite alphabet,
something, anything try distract discomfort. totally
honest, not matter sake dopamine release. dopamine release
triggered continues even get cold water. Now,
study, long exposure cold water. hour. long period time.
warn getting cold water cold will make
temperature drop make hyperthermic hour. actually
dangerous lot people. might hard time reheating, hypothermia
not good thing. people monitoring subjects studies paying
attention core body temperature. able reheat afterwards.
well-established now getting cold water, whether not shower, ice
bath circulating cold water, stream, et cetera, can evoke norepinephrine
release immediately, long arc dopamine release.
good? now, basically said getting increases dopamine detrimental
baseline. Well, appear raise baseline dopamine substantial
periods time. people report feeling heightened level calm focus


getting cold water. cold water exposure turns potent
stimulus shifting entire milieu, entire environment brain body
allowing many people feel much, much better substantial period time
getting ice bath cold water kind before. Now, might
ask often this? people every day. can stimulating.
typically early day, going better. don't necessarily recommend
right sleep, people afternoon. people will
indeed seven days week, people three days week, people every
while. can say become cold water adapted, no
longer impact novelty feeling bit like a, don't want say shock
system, 'cause don't want go cold water shock,
comfortable you, will no longer evoke release. really seem
something pathway cold water exposure norepinephrine
pathway mesolimbic brainstem causes release dopamine.
nonetheless, basically zero cost. mean, need access water sort,
cold water shower, et cetera, basically zero cost way triggering long lasting
increase dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please
again, approach safety caution mind, potent stimulus.

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

01:37:55 Tool 7 Tuning Dopamine Ongoing Motivation

Again, 250% rise baseline, two half times rise baseline rivals
cocaine really remarkable. Now, like talk positive aspects
rewards behavior, negative aspects rewards behavior.
that, will suggest protocol can achieve better relationship
activities dopamine system. fact, will help tune dopamine
system discipline, hard work motivation. Hard work hard. Generally,
people don't like working hard. people do, people work hard order
achieve end goal. End goals terrific rewards terrific whether not
monetary social kind. However, way dopamine
relates perception time, working hard something sake reward
comes afterward, can make hard work much challenging make us much
less likely lean hard work future. Let give couple examples
way data experiments. classic experiment done actually Stanford


many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving

least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason

interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous

drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral

mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-

many years ago children nursery school kindergarten drew pictures,
drew pictures cause like draw. researchers took kids liked draw
started giving reward drawing. reward generally gold star
thing young child find rewarding. stopped giving
gold star. found children much lower tendency draw
own. No reward. Now, remember activity prior receiving
reward, children intrinsically enjoyed selected do. No one telling
draw. relates so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement.
receive rewards, even give rewards something, tend associate
less pleasure actual activity evoked reward. Now, might seem
counterintuitive, just way way dopaminergic circuits work.
now understanding peaks baselines dopamine won't review
again, make sense. get peak dopamine reward, going
lower baseline cognitive interpretation didn't really activity
enjoyed activity. reward. Now, doesn't mean
rewards kinds bad, also important understand dopamine controls
perception time. much dopamine experience way
carve call experience time. engage activity, say
school hard work kind exercise reward going give
receive end, trophy, sundae, meal, whatever happens
be. actually extending time bin analyzing perceiving
experience. reward comes end, start dissociate
neural circuits dopamine reward normally active
activity. arrives end time, experience less
less pleasure particular activity it. Now,
antithesis growth mindset. colleague Stanford, Carol Dweck, many
know, come incredible theory principle, actually goes beyond
theory principle called "Growth Mindset", striving better
mindset not yet, striving end goal. course
delivers tremendous performance. observed
again, people growth mindset, kids growth mindset end
performing well focused effort itself. us can
cultivate growth mindset. neural mechanism cultivating growth mindset involves
learning access rewards effort doing. hard


engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

engage prefrontal component mesolimbic circuit. tell
yourself, okay, effort great, effort pleasureful. Even though might
actually state physical pain exercise, can recall college,
just feeling like wanted get desk, forcing study, forcing
forcing myself. find time can start associate
dopamine release. can evoke dopamine release friction challenge
happen in. completely eliminate ability generate circuits
rewarding process able reward friction effort,
focused goal comes end. way dopamine
marks time. say, oh, going hard thing, going push
push push push end goal comes later. Not enjoy
process less, actually make painful
engaging it. make less efficient it, able access
dopamine effort, dopamine incredible properties increasing
amount energy body, mind, ability focus way dopamines
conversion epinephrin. also undermining ability lean back
activity next time. next time need twice much coffee three times
much loud music, four times much energy drink social connection just
get door order run study. beneficial fact can
serve tremendous amplifier endeavors engage in. Especially hard
endeavors A, not start layering sources dopamine order get
starting line, not layering sources dopamine order able continue,
rather subjectively start attach feeling friction effort internally
generated reward system. not meant vague, system exists
mind, exists minds humans hundreds thousands years,
not just pursuing things innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,
water thirsty. beauty mesolimbic reward pathway talked
earlier that, includes forebrain. can tell effort part
good part. know painful, know doesn't feel good, focused this.
going start access reward. will find rewards, meaning dopamine
release inside effort repeat again. beautiful
that, starts become reflexive types effort. focus
trophy, grade, win reward, undermine entire
process. this? moments intense


friction. tell painful painful, will evoke
increase dopamine release later, meaning will increase baseline dopamine,
also tell moment choice
love it. know sounds like lying yourself,
ways lying yourself, lying context truth
want feel better. want feel even pleasureful. Now, far
away different thinking reward comes end, hot fudge
sundae cross finish line can replace hot fudge sundae
whatever reward happens appealing you. revere people capable
describing. David Goggins comes mind really good example. Many
probably familiar David Goggins, former Navy SEAL essentially
made post-military career explaining sharing process turning effort
reward. many examples too, course. Throughout
evolutionary history, no question revered people willing go
forage hunt gather caretake ways members
species probably found exhausting probably preferred just put
feet soaked cool stream rather continue forage. ability
access pleasure effort aspect dopaminergic circuitry without question
powerful aspect dopamine biology dopamine. beautiful
thing accessible us. just highlight things can interfere with,
prevent getting dopamine release effort itself,

01:47:40 Tool 8 Intermittent Fasting: Effects Dopamine

don't spike dopamine prior engaging effort. don't spike dopamine
engaging effort, learn spike dopamine effort itself. One straightforward
example learning attach dopamine effort strain opposed process
reward naturally evokes dopamine release so-called intermittent fasting. know
popular nowadays. people like intermittent fasting, people
don't. people 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, people
long fasts two three days even. personally don't monitor feeding window
lot precision. tend skip one meal day, either breakfast lunch, eat
two meals day depending meal skipped. either
breakfast, lunch maybe little something evening, skip breakfast


lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive
behaviors, hardwired behaviors. beauty dopamine circuits.
beauty dopamine. not just attached primitive food, sex, heat, et
cetera. also attached things decide good us important
us. telling exercise fasting studying listening better
kind behavior good

01:53:09 Validation Pre-Existing Beliefs Increases Dopamine

will actually reinforce extent good chemical level.
somewhat eerie example just mentioned study published last
year journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. showed
hearing something reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine
release. dopamine pathway vulnerable subjective interpretation
actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances
increasing levels dopamine desirable advantageous clinically
helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

depression treatment smoking people desiring quit smoking.
course lot people seeking increase
baseline levels dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various
compounds behaviors talked today. Indeed cold water exposure leads
huge increases dopamine talked before, sustained ones
that. realize giving lot information science mechanism way
psychological biological circuitry synaptic transmission, volumetric
transmission forth, might seem overwhelming. important thing
understand, dopamine pathways really control.
locus control resides fact previous levels dopamine influencing
levels dopamine right now. current levels dopamine
take next, will influence dopamine levels next days weeks come.
hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
tap dopaminergic system, behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, non-
prescription, et cetera, feel control dopamine
system. certainly better understanding dopamine system
can modulate

Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.

night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient

huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated

interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin

lunch dinner on. Many people now eating way part, many
people find easier not eat eat smaller portion food.
everything dopamine reward evoking properties food.
ingest food ingest food, dopamine levels go up.
typically ingest food, evokes dopamine release, tend want
even food. Remember dopamine's main role one motivation seeking.
dopamine always wants dopamine. activity thing
evokes dopamine release. Well, just look fasting perspective
dopamine schedules dopamine release peaks baselines. Typically,
eat get dopamine release, especially eat hungry.
ever gone camping, very, hungry, food tastes much better.
actually way deprivation states increase way
dopaminergic circuits work. perception dopamine heightened
receptors dopamine not seen much dopamine lately, haven't bound much
dopamine. fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, finally eat, evokes
dopamine release. big reward comes end. Even bigger
deprived yourself. true rewarding behaviors activities way.
longer restrict activity, greater dopamine experience
dopamine finally released, upregulation receptors
dopamine. just spent five minutes telling avoid
much reward end, actually focus dopamine can
consciously evoke deprivation strain effort. fact,
happens many people start fasting take liking it. Many people say
state mind fast clearer, actually start enjoy
period fasting. fact, people start pushing eating window skipping
entire days eating order get deeper state mind
surely not just dopamine, dopamine released. will track clock. Oh,
fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. starting attach dopamine
release create dopamine release deprivation, not food reward itself.
think makes interesting practice. one certainly
practiced centuries different cultures different religions deliberately
restricting food, not just increase rewarding properties food itself, also
increase rewarding properties deprivation. emphasize lot
subjective aspects knowledge benefits fasting serve reinforcing


dopamine amplifying aspects fasting, meaning somebody intermittent fasting
deep fast telling themselves, oh, blood lipid
profiles probably improving. glucose management probably improving.
insulin sensitivity going up, going live longer. things
basis animal studies basis not human studies, kind
still emerging literature, seem pointing direction fasting
can encourage things like autophagy, engulfment dead cells things
sort. Well, people tell things, enhancing rewarding
properties behavior fasting. salient example
knowledge knowledge can actually help us change deep primitive circuits
related dopamine. illustrates forebrain, carries knowledge
carries interpretation rational thought can used shape circuits
involved generating reward otherwise just kind primitive

actually makes see something hear something validates
belief already have, can increase dopamine release. Along lines
dopamine dopamine schedules

01:53:50 Tool 9 Quitting Sugar & Highly Palatable Foods: 48 Hours

perception things can shape way experience things pleasureful
not. beautiful studies mainly looking sugar appetite sense


pleasure sweet things, also savory foods, et cetera. essentially
results come following. ingest something like,
tastes good you, ingest something even sweeter even
savory. go back food ate previously. Well, don't like
much, might seem like duh, obviously. shift perception can
blocked blocking shift dopamine. really speaks peaks
valleys dopamine mentioned experience anything
going depend prior experience things evoke dopamine. Big
dopamine release makes challenging experience big dopamine release.
dopamine one things don't want high low long.
staying dynamic range going different everybody.
savory foods now everywhere, highly savory foods
think call highly palatable foods making bland foods, whole foods,
meaning foods aren't processed. making tastes less good least
while. takes short period time, even just days, two days not
consuming highly palatable foods suddenly broccoli just little bit
seasoning tastes delicious you. right? again, just speaks fact
dopamine universal currency. establishes value based on,

01:55:36 Pornography

not just experiencing moment, experienced days
minutes before. Now, understand previous level dopamine
relates current level dopamine, current level dopamine will
influence future level dopamine, become obvious things like
pornography, not just accessibility pornography, intensity pornography
can negatively shape real world romantic sexual interactions. serious
concern. discussion happening now. underlying neurobiological mechanisms
now understand. isn't pass judgment whether not people like
don't like pornography, ethical discussion, moral discussion
decided individual virtue age, et cetera. again, activity
evokes lot dopamine release will make harder achieve level
certainly greater level dopamine subsequent interaction. yes, indeed
many people addicted pornography yes, indeed many people regularly


indulge

01:56:50 Wellbutrin & Depression & Anxiety

pornography experienced challenges real-world romantic interactions. now
understand mechanisms behind telling you. Now, circumstances

helpful. Good example drug Welbutrin also called bupropion
increases dopamine norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion developed
alternative treatment depression people take so-called SSRI,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors name suggests increased serotonin
suffer serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased
libido, sometimes increased appetite side effects don't want.
Wellbutrin seems avoid sexual side effects. can blunt appetite sorts
things increase norepinephrine dopamine increases levels
motivation craving, also can create state elevated alertness can
sometimes get way healthy eating things sort. one work
clinician psychiatrist. prescription drug order find dosage
Welbutrin correct them. addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can
increase anxiety way dopamine norepinephrine stimulating
tend place people heightened levels alertness. Nonetheless, many people
gained terrific relief depression Wellbutrin bupropion, many
people serious trouble SSRI. seem
useful drug certain contexts,

01:58:30 Tool 10 Mucuna Pruriens, Prolactin, Sperm, Crash Warning

nowadays exist lot supplements that. two common ones
directly within dopamine pathway Macuna Pruriens actually
velvety bean whose contents l-DOPA. Believe not, content
precursor dopamine. Macuna Pruriens sold counter least


United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred

United States. literally precursor dopamine. Meaning take it,
will experience large increases dopamine. increases transient
very, intense. fact, look constellation effects Macuna
Pruriens, find pretty striking look lot like not identical
l-DOPA. obvious context Parkinson's disease.
least five studies shown Macuna Pruriens can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease, much way l-DOPA can reduce symptoms
Parkinson's disease. shouldn't come surprise given just told
essentially l-DOPA. also can reduce particular hormone called prolactin.
Dopamine prolactin tend somewhat push pull fashion. dopamine
up, prolactin vice versa. Prolactin involved milk letdown women.
involved setting refractory period sex ejaculation males. reason
mating can occur not occur ejaculation increase
prolactin. Macuna Pruriens often used blunt prolactin, actually couple
studies showing can indeed that. Macuna Pruriens number
effects lie sex reproduction pathway worth noting. Sperm
concentration, sperm quality actually greatly increased Macuna Pruriens.
kind curious effects understand little bit biology
dopamine mention moment, several studies, four fact
describe Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, sperm
motility. seeking conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might
interesting choice interested exploring non-prescription compounds. However,
mention time consume substance increases dopamine
mimicking dopamine acting direct precursor dopamine, almost
inevitably crash reduction baseline dopamine referred
previously. many people take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really
motivated, really alert, sorts things one expect dopaminergic
drug Macuna Pruriens is. feel low reduction drive
excitement enthusiasm drug wears off. Just like
dopamine

02:01:45 Tool 11 L-Tyrosine: Dosages, Duration Effects & Specificity

increasing compound. reason, many people turned use L-


tyrosine. L-tyrosine amino acid precursor l-DOPA. lies
dopamine synthesis pathway. nowadays common L-tyrosine
sold counter United States people will take L-tyrosine way get
energized alert focused. Indeed, data L-tyrosine will accomplish
that. L-tyrosine typically taken capsule form powder form anywhere 500
750 1000 milligrams. potent stimulus increasing dopamine.
timescale increasing dopamine 30 45 minutes ingestion. Dopamine
levels start peak. classic study really nailed fact tyrosine
effect published way back 1983, Journal Clinical Endocrinology
Metabolism directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation tryptophan ingestion
plasma dopamine serotonin. Tryptophan precursor serotonin.
indeed found ingestion L-tyrosine can increase amount
dopamine circulating blood brain too, course. L-tyrosine
ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes short-lasting
30 minutes effect dissipated, meaning levels dopamine
dropped baseline. even though didn't look levels baseline
dopamine past time point, expectation based everything know
dopamine biology drop baseline due depletion
readily reservable pool dopamine vesicles talked way back
beginning episode. nice thing study show specificity
effect ingestion tryptophan not increase dopamine instead increased
serotonin. really specificity pathways rule placebo type
effects. not suggesting anybody, everybody increase dopamine levels
way tyrosine Macuna Pruriens. seeking increase
dopamine levels without prescription drugs, direct route that.
course, pre-existing dopaminergic condition, schizophrenia psychosis
kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens L-tyrosine will not good
you. don't, just understand expect going lead
increase dopamine. certainly feel elevated state
might agitating, might really pleasureful, will feel
crash afterwards. deep crash will really depend biology
dopamine baseline began. personally not fan using things like Macuna
Pruriens reasons mentioned earlier, just intense
much crash. use L-tyrosine time time enhancing focus


motivation, want emphasize time time. might use week,
occasionally twice week, never one take L-tyrosine regularly order
focus train kind mental work. just don't want rely exogenous
substance order get dopamine circuits activated. don't want experience
drop dopamine

02:05:20 Tool 12 Avoiding Melatonin Supplementation, & Avoiding Light 10pm-4am

inevitably occurs period time afterwards. also mention things
can reduce levels baseline dopamine. One rarely discussed melatonin.
talked podcast melatonin, not fan using
melatonin order enhance sleep. can help one get sleep, not stay asleep.
Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert University California, Berkeley. think don't want
put words mouth, discussion melatonin podcast
Matt guest book podcasts, Matt generally stated
use melatonin except treatment jet lag generally not good idea. agree.
think melatonin not often thought impacting dopamine pathway,
least one study published 2001 first author Nishiyama just sounds.
spelled just sounds. Acute effects melatonin administration cardiovascular
autonomic regulation healthy men. study wasn't specifically dopamine,
looked norepinephrine dopamine levels, found statistically
significant decrease dopamine 60 minutes melatonin administration. talked
viewing bright lights hours 10:00 p.m 4:00 a.m
shown studies Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists
reduce levels dopamine several days light exposure. dim lights
night, can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning don't take
melatonin

02:07:00 Tool 13 Phenylethylamine (with Alpha-GPC) Dopamine Focus/Energy

can find better alternative good idea want maintain
healthy levels dopamine. Now, one compound familiar with,
probably actually taken without realizing it, increases dopamine.
something called PEA phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine.


PEA found various foods. Chocolate just happens one enriched PEA
can increase synaptic levels dopamine. personally take PEA time time
focus work aid order intense bouts work. Again, don't often.
might week every two weeks. might use training,
typically don't, usually mental work. will take 500 milligrams PEA
take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC. something personally do.
right me, within margins safety health. Again, check
doctor decide right you. leads sharp transient
increase dopamine lasts 30 45 minutes. least system
found much regulated kind even something like L-tyrosine
certainly much regulated even

02:08:20 Tool 14 Huperzine

lower dopamine release something like Macuna Pruriens. One lesser
talked compounds there, gaining popularity increasing
dopamine so-called nootropic something called huperzine A. Huperzine
compound sold counter least United States can increase
acetylcholine transmission, different neuromodulator entirely. interesting
huperzine somehow way interactions cholinergic system
dopaminergic system leads increases dopamine medial prefrontal cortex
hippocampus. Hippocampus, course, area brain associated
learning memory. prefrontal cortex associated mesolimbic
pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. think reason seeing
increase popularity companies including huperzine nootropic compounds
cholinergic stimulating properties, also stimulating dopamine
release. personally never tried huperzine A. can go www.examine.com
put huperzine PubMed like search around see science
behind it. Again, not recommending anyone take things. fact, recommend
anyone just diving in, starting consume things without gaining knowledge
function, whether not right you. nonetheless, think
years come, going see lot L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine
huperzine way tapping dopaminergic cholinergic circuits
certainly along things like Alpha-GPC non-prescription, short-lived somewhat


milder alternatives things really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin,
modafinil, armodafinil

02:10:02 Social Connections, Oxytocin & Dopamine Release

similar. can't help share one result. not related
pharmacology. related behaviors social interactions.
interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good
present moment. typically think think
opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

02:12:20 Direct & Indirect Effects: e.g., Maca; Synthesis & Application



dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect
pathways related cortisol can increase dopamine. not direct increase
dopamine. consequence, rather subtle compared various

interesting say important finding made years ago
colleague, Rob Malenka, department psychiatry Stanford, showing
oxytocin social connection actually directly stimulating dopamine pathway.
think many years, us including hear thought oxytocin
serotonergic pathway pair bonding,
neuromodulators associated things related feeling good

opioid system serotonergic system. dopamine system really seeking
reward, paper published 2017 journal Science, excellent journal.
papers titled gaining social reward oxytocin, excuse me, ventral
tegmental area. now know ventral tegmental area, area
mesolimbic pathway. paper essentially showed that, oxytocin social
connection pair bonding triggers dopamine release. everyone read
result, realized, ah, makes total sense evolution species,
indeed species social connections important, also important go
seek social connections. so, fun think pharmacology
underlying neurocircuitry cold water baths different things related
dopamine schedules reward mechanisms attaching reward effort
various things talked today terms science tools protocols,
remiss didn't include description result just emphasize social
connections, close social connections particular evoke oxytocin release.
romantic type, parent-child type, friendship related,
can even just friends distance related, right? doesn't actually require skin
contact get oxytocin release, oxytocin release central stimulating

dopamine pathways. take home message quite simple, engage
pursue quality, healthy social interactions. know covered lot material today.
really tried hard focus things lie directly within dopamine pathway
circuitries, well things directly stimulate pathways circuitries.
haven't talked things indirectly serve dopamine pathways.
internet indeed scientific literature, will find instance,
things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like gut microbiome can
influence dopamine. indeed can, indirect mechanisms.
creating environment, milieu dopamine dopamine circuits can
flourish. Maca good example that. will reduce cortisol indirect

hope mechanisms now hand plus tools
