00:03:10 Brain-Body Contract

deep love understanding biology medicine ways can
benefit you. pleased announce hosting two live events May, 2022.
first live event will take place Seattle, Washington May 17th. second live event
will take place Portland, Oregon May 18th. part lecture series entitled,
"The Brain Body Contract" will talk science science-based
tools. Many overlap topics covered Huberman Lab Podcast,
will not will completely new topics tools never discussed
publicly before. live events will also include question answer period
audience can ask questions directly aspect science
science-based tools will attempt answer them. Tickets two events, again,
Seattle May 17th Portland May 18th, available
hubermanlab.com/tour. begin today's episode, want emphasize
podcast separate teaching research roles Stanford.

00:04:10 Thesis, InsideTracker, ROKA

however part desire effort bring zero cost consumer information
science science-related tools general public. keeping
theme, like thank sponsors today's podcast. first sponsor Thesis.
Thesis makes nootropics. fact make custom nootropics. Now
nootropic? Technically nootropics means smart drug. Frankly, not big fan
word nootropics, smart? mean, creativity, focus,
task switching, different aspects brain body engage different aspects


cognition, many can call smart. emotional intelligence,
analytic intelligence, logic, creativity. Thesis understands
designed custom nootropics designed bring body brain specific state
want. instance, specific nootropics creativity,
nootropics focus, nootropics motivation, on, forth. addition
that, nootropics custom designed you. use highest quality
ingredients, things like alpha-GPC phosphatidylserine, talked
podcast before. also use ingredients like ginkgo biloba, many people
use, like benefit from. However, also people like can't take ginkgo
biloba, gives terrible headaches. learned long time ago.
simply can't take nootropic supplement matter includes ginkgo
biloba. sure not alone fact ingredients work others
not. Thesis solved problem individual variation creating brief quiz.

00:08:24 Preventative Medicine & Hormone Health

now discussion hormone health optimization Dr. Kyle Gillett.
Dr. Gillett, welcome. - Thank me. - Well, super excited talk you,
found podcast immediately became clear
encyclopedia knowledge hormone health men women across
lifespan. many, many questions, dive questions,
love just get little bit background terms medical training
particular orientation toward treating patients. think
whole landscape call hormone health? hormone?
envision people managing hormones? just kind fill
blanks us, think lot people appreciate it. - Absolutely, dual
board-certified family medicine obesity medicine. kind tailored training
order provide call balanced approach total health, includes body,
mind, soul. recently saw podcast Joe Rogan Mr. Beast. Joe asks
Mr. Beast, "How become amazing YouTuber great
clickbait videos, become good it?" turns just became
obsessed teenager. essentially tailored education
well. become obsessed optimal human performance, body, mind,


even spirit. attended med school University Kansas, one
med schools still emphasizes full-spectrum care. emphasize
exercise medicine. emphasize food medicine, active
interest groups. residency, active lot mindfulness curriculum.
also things like Walk Doc emphasize preventative medicine.
something kind got away from. niche led hormone
health. didn't really start hormone health, important component
health general many people don't emphasize. - Great, well, idea
preventative medicine, think, starting really take hold general population,
especially given events last years, people realize showing
health challenges bunch different levels. people feeling
robust, people feeling back heels. someone comes
patient, first things want know them? mean,
obviously want know blood pressure. want know something
mental health family history. terms hormone health, sorts
probe questions ask looking for? ask
like people able ask questions themselves. - Yeah,
physical exam history, lot different parts.
history present illness complaint, maybe patient doesn't
complaint. case, things like social history family history
extremely important, gives insight genetics insight
hormone health. patients will tell me, oh, doin' okay, helps ask
them, well, now? say patient 50. now versus
20, changed? gotten question lot, get
doctor order better lab workup even include basic hormones?
no magic answer that, really helps tell them, energy not
good used be. focus not good used be. athletic
performance not good used be. don't pathology
order lab indicated. just pertinent symptom. - think going
really helpful, many people, idea getting blood test look
hormones just seems like enormous hurdle get over, many doctors
won't prescribe them. say it's, using approach just described,
equally effective men women find that, one reason
another, men women different challenges advantages trying


access deeper hormone data? - Yeah. slightly different. women,
lot objective data. menstrual irregularities not havin'
period, heavy periods, things talk
frequently doctor. Men hesitant. men really want know
testosterone is, time, really don't want tell doctor
libido energy is, almost like feel less masculine
feel less like guy say even just talking doctor
it. - Yeah, think raises really important point, whole
discussion around hormone health bit barbed wire topic, many ways
hear word hormone, think testosterone estrogen, think notions
masculinity femininity. course testosterone estrogen present
sexes, right? chromosomal backgrounds. just varying degrees ratios.
also raises issues sexual health kind interesting, 'cause
surrounded medical doctors lab Stanford. physicians
surround with, open discussion around sexual health
reproductive health. general population, think topics little
bit taboo kind barbed wire. think people seeking lot
information YouTube communities may

00:14:17 Six Pillars Hormone Health Optimization

may not educated actual biology. along lines,
probably assume hormones changing across lifespan, right? Certainly
childhood puberty onward. would, love just kind take snapshot
think everybody thinking optimize hormone
health, male female, in, say 20s. maybe migrate
30s 40s. that, just tell us everyone
hormone health puberty onward? - Yeah, law diminishing returns
applies. little amount call lifestyle interventions long period
time going far helpful efficacious lot nothing
lot nothing. talk big six pillars. two
strongest ones likely diet exercise. hormone health, specifically resistance
training particularly helpful. diet, caloric restriction can particularly helpful,
especially epidemic metabolic syndrome continuing go


country developed countries general. two powerful.
number one number two diet exercise. last four, little bit
alliteration. stress stress optimization. cortisol,
mental health, societal health, collective
health family well. member family even close
friend trying achieve optimal health together important. thing
nicotine cessation. thing hormone optimization.
household unit, far helpful. stress, sleep optimization. Sleep
extremely important, especially mitochondrial health well.
sunlight, encompasses anything outdoors. move more,
cold exposure, heat exposure, sunlight. last one spirit.
kind body, mind, soul. five in, dialed
completely, don't spiritual health, whatever believe,
going profoundly impact body mind well. - Yeah, definitely
going touch notion spiritual health, think people
might draw connotations certain things may may not accurate, know
number academic laboratories focused number of, not just
functional medicine clinics, research clinics hospitals throughout country
achieving really interesting data, not just people quite sick,
healthy people trying

00:17:14 Diet Hormone Health, Blood Testing

optimize health. will definitely touch back that. kind
maybe give us little bit detail areas.
people hear diet, immediately think, okay, now get combat around vegan,
plant-based, carnivore, et cetera. think general view
people probably eating highly processed foods, highly palatable foods
possible, doesn't mean eating foods don't taste good, course.
sorts things recommend realm diet? also want
know caloric restriction, understanding caloric surplus can
actually support certain hormones like testosterone. one combine caloric
restriction still optimize hormones? say really terrific way
think approached diet? - Yeah. Diet individualized approach.


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.

00:08:24 Preventative Medicine & Hormone Health

now discussion hormone health optimization Dr. Kyle Gillett.
Dr. Gillett, welcome. - Thank me. - Well, super excited talk you,
found podcast immediately became clear
encyclopedia knowledge hormone health men women across
lifespan. many, many questions, dive questions,
love just get little bit background terms medical training
particular orientation toward treating patients. think
whole landscape call hormone health? hormone?
envision people managing hormones? just kind fill
blanks us, think lot people appreciate it. - Absolutely, dual
board-certified family medicine obesity medicine. kind tailored training
order provide call balanced approach total health, includes body,
mind, soul. recently saw podcast Joe Rogan Mr. Beast. Joe asks
Mr. Beast, "How become amazing YouTuber great
clickbait videos, become good it?" turns just became
obsessed teenager. essentially tailored education
well. become obsessed optimal human performance, body, mind,


even spirit. attended med school University Kansas, one
med schools still emphasizes full-spectrum care. emphasize
exercise medicine. emphasize food medicine, active
interest groups. residency, active lot mindfulness curriculum.
also things like Walk Doc emphasize preventative medicine.
something kind got away from. niche led hormone
health. didn't really start hormone health, important component
health general many people don't emphasize. - Great, well, idea
preventative medicine, think, starting really take hold general population,
especially given events last years, people realize showing
health challenges bunch different levels. people feeling
robust, people feeling back heels. someone comes
patient, first things want know them? mean,
obviously want know blood pressure. want know something
mental health family history. terms hormone health, sorts
probe questions ask looking for? ask
like people able ask questions themselves. - Yeah,
physical exam history, lot different parts.
history present illness complaint, maybe patient doesn't
complaint. case, things like social history family history
extremely important, gives insight genetics insight
hormone health. patients will tell me, oh, doin' okay, helps ask
them, well, now? say patient 50. now versus
20, changed? gotten question lot, get
doctor order better lab workup even include basic hormones?
no magic answer that, really helps tell them, energy not
good used be. focus not good used be. athletic
performance not good used be. don't pathology
order lab indicated. just pertinent symptom. - think going
really helpful, many people, idea getting blood test look
hormones just seems like enormous hurdle get over, many doctors
won't prescribe them. say it's, using approach just described,
equally effective men women find that, one reason
another, men women different challenges advantages trying


access deeper hormone data? - Yeah. slightly different. women,
lot objective data. menstrual irregularities not havin'
period, heavy periods, things talk
frequently doctor. Men hesitant. men really want know
testosterone is, time, really don't want tell doctor
libido energy is, almost like feel less masculine
feel less like guy say even just talking doctor
it. - Yeah, think raises really important point, whole
discussion around hormone health bit barbed wire topic, many ways
hear word hormone, think testosterone estrogen, think notions
masculinity femininity. course testosterone estrogen present
sexes, right? chromosomal backgrounds. just varying degrees ratios.
also raises issues sexual health kind interesting, 'cause
surrounded medical doctors lab Stanford. physicians
surround with, open discussion around sexual health
reproductive health. general population, think topics little
bit taboo kind barbed wire. think people seeking lot
information YouTube communities may

00:14:17 Six Pillars Hormone Health Optimization

may not educated actual biology. along lines,
probably assume hormones changing across lifespan, right? Certainly
childhood puberty onward. would, love just kind take snapshot
think everybody thinking optimize hormone
health, male female, in, say 20s. maybe migrate
30s 40s. that, just tell us everyone
hormone health puberty onward? - Yeah, law diminishing returns
applies. little amount call lifestyle interventions long period
time going far helpful efficacious lot nothing
lot nothing. talk big six pillars. two
strongest ones likely diet exercise. hormone health, specifically resistance
training particularly helpful. diet, caloric restriction can particularly helpful,
especially epidemic metabolic syndrome continuing go


country developed countries general. two powerful.
number one number two diet exercise. last four, little bit
alliteration. stress stress optimization. cortisol,
mental health, societal health, collective
health family well. member family even close
friend trying achieve optimal health together important. thing
nicotine cessation. thing hormone optimization.
household unit, far helpful. stress, sleep optimization. Sleep
extremely important, especially mitochondrial health well.
sunlight, encompasses anything outdoors. move more,
cold exposure, heat exposure, sunlight. last one spirit.
kind body, mind, soul. five in, dialed
completely, don't spiritual health, whatever believe,
going profoundly impact body mind well. - Yeah, definitely
going touch notion spiritual health, think people
might draw connotations certain things may may not accurate, know
number academic laboratories focused number of, not just
functional medicine clinics, research clinics hospitals throughout country
achieving really interesting data, not just people quite sick,
healthy people trying

00:17:14 Diet Hormone Health, Blood Testing

optimize health. will definitely touch back that. kind
maybe give us little bit detail areas.
people hear diet, immediately think, okay, now get combat around vegan,
plant-based, carnivore, et cetera. think general view
people probably eating highly processed foods, highly palatable foods
possible, doesn't mean eating foods don't taste good, course.
sorts things recommend realm diet? also want
know caloric restriction, understanding caloric surplus can
actually support certain hormones like testosterone. one combine caloric
restriction still optimize hormones? say really terrific way
think approached diet? - Yeah. Diet individualized approach.


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

00:08:24 Preventative Medicine & Hormone Health

now discussion hormone health optimization Dr. Kyle Gillett.
Dr. Gillett, welcome. - Thank me. - Well, super excited talk you,
found podcast immediately became clear
encyclopedia knowledge hormone health men women across
lifespan. many, many questions, dive questions,
love just get little bit background terms medical training
particular orientation toward treating patients. think
whole landscape call hormone health? hormone?
envision people managing hormones? just kind fill
blanks us, think lot people appreciate it. - Absolutely, dual
board-certified family medicine obesity medicine. kind tailored training
order provide call balanced approach total health, includes body,
mind, soul. recently saw podcast Joe Rogan Mr. Beast. Joe asks
Mr. Beast, "How become amazing YouTuber great
clickbait videos, become good it?" turns just became
obsessed teenager. essentially tailored education
well. become obsessed optimal human performance, body, mind,


even spirit. attended med school University Kansas, one
med schools still emphasizes full-spectrum care. emphasize
exercise medicine. emphasize food medicine, active
interest groups. residency, active lot mindfulness curriculum.
also things like Walk Doc emphasize preventative medicine.
something kind got away from. niche led hormone
health. didn't really start hormone health, important component
health general many people don't emphasize. - Great, well, idea
preventative medicine, think, starting really take hold general population,
especially given events last years, people realize showing
health challenges bunch different levels. people feeling
robust, people feeling back heels. someone comes
patient, first things want know them? mean,
obviously want know blood pressure. want know something
mental health family history. terms hormone health, sorts
probe questions ask looking for? ask
like people able ask questions themselves. - Yeah,
physical exam history, lot different parts.
history present illness complaint, maybe patient doesn't
complaint. case, things like social history family history
extremely important, gives insight genetics insight
hormone health. patients will tell me, oh, doin' okay, helps ask
them, well, now? say patient 50. now versus
20, changed? gotten question lot, get
doctor order better lab workup even include basic hormones?
no magic answer that, really helps tell them, energy not
good used be. focus not good used be. athletic
performance not good used be. don't pathology
order lab indicated. just pertinent symptom. - think going
really helpful, many people, idea getting blood test look
hormones just seems like enormous hurdle get over, many doctors
won't prescribe them. say it's, using approach just described,
equally effective men women find that, one reason
another, men women different challenges advantages trying


access deeper hormone data? - Yeah. slightly different. women,
lot objective data. menstrual irregularities not havin'
period, heavy periods, things talk
frequently doctor. Men hesitant. men really want know
testosterone is, time, really don't want tell doctor
libido energy is, almost like feel less masculine
feel less like guy say even just talking doctor
it. - Yeah, think raises really important point, whole
discussion around hormone health bit barbed wire topic, many ways
hear word hormone, think testosterone estrogen, think notions
masculinity femininity. course testosterone estrogen present
sexes, right? chromosomal backgrounds. just varying degrees ratios.
also raises issues sexual health kind interesting, 'cause
surrounded medical doctors lab Stanford. physicians
surround with, open discussion around sexual health
reproductive health. general population, think topics little
bit taboo kind barbed wire. think people seeking lot
information YouTube communities may

00:14:17 Six Pillars Hormone Health Optimization

may not educated actual biology. along lines,
probably assume hormones changing across lifespan, right? Certainly
childhood puberty onward. would, love just kind take snapshot
think everybody thinking optimize hormone
health, male female, in, say 20s. maybe migrate
30s 40s. that, just tell us everyone
hormone health puberty onward? - Yeah, law diminishing returns
applies. little amount call lifestyle interventions long period
time going far helpful efficacious lot nothing
lot nothing. talk big six pillars. two
strongest ones likely diet exercise. hormone health, specifically resistance
training particularly helpful. diet, caloric restriction can particularly helpful,
especially epidemic metabolic syndrome continuing go


country developed countries general. two powerful.
number one number two diet exercise. last four, little bit
alliteration. stress stress optimization. cortisol,
mental health, societal health, collective
health family well. member family even close
friend trying achieve optimal health together important. thing
nicotine cessation. thing hormone optimization.
household unit, far helpful. stress, sleep optimization. Sleep
extremely important, especially mitochondrial health well.
sunlight, encompasses anything outdoors. move more,
cold exposure, heat exposure, sunlight. last one spirit.
kind body, mind, soul. five in, dialed
completely, don't spiritual health, whatever believe,
going profoundly impact body mind well. - Yeah, definitely
going touch notion spiritual health, think people
might draw connotations certain things may may not accurate, know
number academic laboratories focused number of, not just
functional medicine clinics, research clinics hospitals throughout country
achieving really interesting data, not just people quite sick,
healthy people trying

00:17:14 Diet Hormone Health, Blood Testing

optimize health. will definitely touch back that. kind
maybe give us little bit detail areas.
people hear diet, immediately think, okay, now get combat around vegan,
plant-based, carnivore, et cetera. think general view
people probably eating highly processed foods, highly palatable foods
possible, doesn't mean eating foods don't taste good, course.
sorts things recommend realm diet? also want
know caloric restriction, understanding caloric surplus can
actually support certain hormones like testosterone. one combine caloric
restriction still optimize hormones? say really terrific way
think approached diet? - Yeah. Diet individualized approach.


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


even spirit. attended med school University Kansas, one
med schools still emphasizes full-spectrum care. emphasize
exercise medicine. emphasize food medicine, active
interest groups. residency, active lot mindfulness curriculum.
also things like Walk Doc emphasize preventative medicine.
something kind got away from. niche led hormone
health. didn't really start hormone health, important component
health general many people don't emphasize. - Great, well, idea
preventative medicine, think, starting really take hold general population,
especially given events last years, people realize showing
health challenges bunch different levels. people feeling
robust, people feeling back heels. someone comes
patient, first things want know them? mean,
obviously want know blood pressure. want know something
mental health family history. terms hormone health, sorts
probe questions ask looking for? ask
like people able ask questions themselves. - Yeah,
physical exam history, lot different parts.
history present illness complaint, maybe patient doesn't
complaint. case, things like social history family history
extremely important, gives insight genetics insight
hormone health. patients will tell me, oh, doin' okay, helps ask
them, well, now? say patient 50. now versus
20, changed? gotten question lot, get
doctor order better lab workup even include basic hormones?
no magic answer that, really helps tell them, energy not
good used be. focus not good used be. athletic
performance not good used be. don't pathology
order lab indicated. just pertinent symptom. - think going
really helpful, many people, idea getting blood test look
hormones just seems like enormous hurdle get over, many doctors
won't prescribe them. say it's, using approach just described,
equally effective men women find that, one reason
another, men women different challenges advantages trying


access deeper hormone data? - Yeah. slightly different. women,
lot objective data. menstrual irregularities not havin'
period, heavy periods, things talk
frequently doctor. Men hesitant. men really want know
testosterone is, time, really don't want tell doctor
libido energy is, almost like feel less masculine
feel less like guy say even just talking doctor
it. - Yeah, think raises really important point, whole
discussion around hormone health bit barbed wire topic, many ways
hear word hormone, think testosterone estrogen, think notions
masculinity femininity. course testosterone estrogen present
sexes, right? chromosomal backgrounds. just varying degrees ratios.
also raises issues sexual health kind interesting, 'cause
surrounded medical doctors lab Stanford. physicians
surround with, open discussion around sexual health
reproductive health. general population, think topics little
bit taboo kind barbed wire. think people seeking lot
information YouTube communities may

00:14:17 Six Pillars Hormone Health Optimization

may not educated actual biology. along lines,
probably assume hormones changing across lifespan, right? Certainly
childhood puberty onward. would, love just kind take snapshot
think everybody thinking optimize hormone
health, male female, in, say 20s. maybe migrate
30s 40s. that, just tell us everyone
hormone health puberty onward? - Yeah, law diminishing returns
applies. little amount call lifestyle interventions long period
time going far helpful efficacious lot nothing
lot nothing. talk big six pillars. two
strongest ones likely diet exercise. hormone health, specifically resistance
training particularly helpful. diet, caloric restriction can particularly helpful,
especially epidemic metabolic syndrome continuing go


country developed countries general. two powerful.
number one number two diet exercise. last four, little bit
alliteration. stress stress optimization. cortisol,
mental health, societal health, collective
health family well. member family even close
friend trying achieve optimal health together important. thing
nicotine cessation. thing hormone optimization.
household unit, far helpful. stress, sleep optimization. Sleep
extremely important, especially mitochondrial health well.
sunlight, encompasses anything outdoors. move more,
cold exposure, heat exposure, sunlight. last one spirit.
kind body, mind, soul. five in, dialed
completely, don't spiritual health, whatever believe,
going profoundly impact body mind well. - Yeah, definitely
going touch notion spiritual health, think people
might draw connotations certain things may may not accurate, know
number academic laboratories focused number of, not just
functional medicine clinics, research clinics hospitals throughout country
achieving really interesting data, not just people quite sick,
healthy people trying

00:17:14 Diet Hormone Health, Blood Testing

optimize health. will definitely touch back that. kind
maybe give us little bit detail areas.
people hear diet, immediately think, okay, now get combat around vegan,
plant-based, carnivore, et cetera. think general view
people probably eating highly processed foods, highly palatable foods
possible, doesn't mean eating foods don't taste good, course.
sorts things recommend realm diet? also want
know caloric restriction, understanding caloric surplus can
actually support certain hormones like testosterone. one combine caloric
restriction still optimize hormones? say really terrific way
think approached diet? - Yeah. Diet individualized approach.


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just

access deeper hormone data? - Yeah. slightly different. women,
lot objective data. menstrual irregularities not havin'
period, heavy periods, things talk
frequently doctor. Men hesitant. men really want know
testosterone is, time, really don't want tell doctor
libido energy is, almost like feel less masculine
feel less like guy say even just talking doctor
it. - Yeah, think raises really important point, whole
discussion around hormone health bit barbed wire topic, many ways
hear word hormone, think testosterone estrogen, think notions
masculinity femininity. course testosterone estrogen present
sexes, right? chromosomal backgrounds. just varying degrees ratios.
also raises issues sexual health kind interesting, 'cause
surrounded medical doctors lab Stanford. physicians
surround with, open discussion around sexual health
reproductive health. general population, think topics little
bit taboo kind barbed wire. think people seeking lot
information YouTube communities may

00:14:17 Six Pillars Hormone Health Optimization

may not educated actual biology. along lines,
probably assume hormones changing across lifespan, right? Certainly
childhood puberty onward. would, love just kind take snapshot
think everybody thinking optimize hormone
health, male female, in, say 20s. maybe migrate
30s 40s. that, just tell us everyone
hormone health puberty onward? - Yeah, law diminishing returns
applies. little amount call lifestyle interventions long period
time going far helpful efficacious lot nothing
lot nothing. talk big six pillars. two
strongest ones likely diet exercise. hormone health, specifically resistance
training particularly helpful. diet, caloric restriction can particularly helpful,
especially epidemic metabolic syndrome continuing go


country developed countries general. two powerful.
number one number two diet exercise. last four, little bit
alliteration. stress stress optimization. cortisol,
mental health, societal health, collective
health family well. member family even close
friend trying achieve optimal health together important. thing
nicotine cessation. thing hormone optimization.
household unit, far helpful. stress, sleep optimization. Sleep
extremely important, especially mitochondrial health well.
sunlight, encompasses anything outdoors. move more,
cold exposure, heat exposure, sunlight. last one spirit.
kind body, mind, soul. five in, dialed
completely, don't spiritual health, whatever believe,
going profoundly impact body mind well. - Yeah, definitely
going touch notion spiritual health, think people
might draw connotations certain things may may not accurate, know
number academic laboratories focused number of, not just
functional medicine clinics, research clinics hospitals throughout country
achieving really interesting data, not just people quite sick,
healthy people trying

00:17:14 Diet Hormone Health, Blood Testing

optimize health. will definitely touch back that. kind
maybe give us little bit detail areas.
people hear diet, immediately think, okay, now get combat around vegan,
plant-based, carnivore, et cetera. think general view
people probably eating highly processed foods, highly palatable foods
possible, doesn't mean eating foods don't taste good, course.
sorts things recommend realm diet? also want
know caloric restriction, understanding caloric surplus can
actually support certain hormones like testosterone. one combine caloric
restriction still optimize hormones? say really terrific way
think approached diet? - Yeah. Diet individualized approach.


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

kind body, mind, soul. five in, dialed
completely, don't spiritual health, whatever believe,
going profoundly impact body mind well. - Yeah, definitely
going touch notion spiritual health, think people
might draw connotations certain things may may not accurate, know
number academic laboratories focused number of, not just
functional medicine clinics, research clinics hospitals throughout country
achieving really interesting data, not just people quite sick,
healthy people trying

00:17:14 Diet Hormone Health, Blood Testing

optimize health. will definitely touch back that. kind
maybe give us little bit detail areas.
people hear diet, immediately think, okay, now get combat around vegan,
plant-based, carnivore, et cetera. think general view
people probably eating highly processed foods, highly palatable foods
possible, doesn't mean eating foods don't taste good, course.
sorts things recommend realm diet? also want
know caloric restriction, understanding caloric surplus can
actually support certain hormones like testosterone. one combine caloric
restriction still optimize hormones? say really terrific way
think approached diet? - Yeah. Diet individualized approach.


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


car, car made different requires different sort fuel, whether
race car, whether diesel truck, different fuels different
performance outcomes. trying tow something trying go fast.
way athletes. pretty well studied. intra-workout carbs
ultra long distance athletes take, general, better. think studied
cyclists quite often. also depends genetics. can genetic
polymorphism metabolize carbs sugar better, even
unopposed fiber. - one determine whether not
polymorphism? mean, omnivore, eat high quality meats, not
huge quantities, also eat vegetables starches, feel fine. never done
elimination diet. think low carb diet gave lot
psoriasis poor sleep, backed off. probably didn't correctly, know lot
people quite well low carb zero carb diet. - Yeah, particularly
risk cancer, less glucose can easily
uptaken cells. also people autoimmune diseases. - tend
well auto- - lower carb diets, yeah. yeah, far know,
basically can use biofeedback, feeling, guess tolerate
well, can just get genetic testing, can fairly expensive, all,
requires physician someone knows interpret test accurately. -
someone means say getting regular blood testing good
idea? so, regular blood testing? every three months? every six
months? course backdrop life changing too, stress levels, et cetera. - Yeah,
every three six months preventative purposes, times need blood tests
faster frequencies that. also get blood test
fasting not fasting. looking damage beach,
don't just look low tide, look high tide see happening

00:20:21 Exercise Hormone Health

high tide well. - think great way put it. terms general
recommendations around exercise, mean, mind, based data
seen, almost everybody should, everybody getting 150 180 minutes
minimum Zone 2 cardio per week kind continue
conversation, one exert effort, hard time getting


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -

science. [energetic music]


words out. least that, right? cardiovascular health general brain health
musculoskeletal health plus resistance exercise. less contour
recommend? - Yeah, less contour.
Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise,

00:21:06 Caloric Restriction, Obesity & Testosterone

slightly less important long duration caloric restriction is. - Interesting,
brings us caloric restriction. clear caloric restriction can allow one
lose weight, right? classic CICO, C-I-C-O, calories calories out. not
disputing calories calories out. somehow always stated 50 times
forum whatever follows, people think will anchor to, assume
don't mean that, know agree calories calories
fundamental law thermodynamics. clear based read
one slight caloric surplus hormones like testosterone can
optimized, true somebody showing excessive body fat?
work? body fat manufacturing enzymes convert
testosterone estrogen. words, someone know use
caloric restriction avoid caloric restriction? - Yeah, parse out.
delve details bit more, say, board-certified obesity
medicine physician, obviously laws thermodynamics apply. addition
that, nothing special intermittent fasting caloric restriction exercise
pertains losing body weight general. lose weight, 33%
lean body mass. 10% fat cells, adipose cells actually lean
body mass well, proteins water things like
reason exercise reason caloric restriction general, including intermittent
fasting, health reasons. increase health span. not necessarily
going make weight scale change, doesn't matter much.
fairly well studied mice humans. much easier study mice.
precursor six types people, ones care mice studies ones
care human studies. correctly restrict mice 40%, can
improved testosterone parameters, obese start. appears
way humans well. easy way think
obese metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will improve


testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not

testosterone. study talk studies
systematic review Mayo Clinic Proceedings March last year. note
study young, healthy men calorically restrict
testosterone decrease. young healthy don't
metabolic syndrome, caloric restriction will likely decrease testosterone.

00:23:55 Intermittent Fasting, Growth Hormone (GH), IGF-1

- clarifies lot me. believe will clarify lot people well.
delighted pointed distinction intermittent fasting not
way achieve caloric restriction. number young, healthy, older,
healthy people know like using intermittent fasting, even not trying lose
weight, couple reasons. believe might extend lifespan. think
still bit open question. bit hard experiment do, control
group is, no one wants control group say. - mice. - Right. Exactly. -
Captive audience. - Exactly, feature little bit tricky many
people like intermittent fasting mental effects, clarity mind
feel fasting, increased pleasure eating finally eat
referring intermittent fasting sort eating windows anywhere 8
12 hours day. Not extended fasts 24 hours more. question therefore is,
healthy lean enough person, right? Non-obese person, intermittent fasting bad
idea terms hormone health? oscillating period kind feast
famine within 24 hours problem one getting sufficient calories maintain
weight? - Yeah, caloric maintenance, not going be, not
going deleterious. not going bad hormone health.
couple different hormones can talk about. can talk testosterone. can
talk DHEA, usually go hand hand. can also talk
growth hormone, not steroid hormone, peptide hormone.
chain proteins, amino acids put together instead sterile, think sterile
hormones coming cholesterol. intermittent fasting, get little spike
growth hormone eat, also get huge spike growth hormone,
significant, less negligible spike overnight. improved intermittent
fasting. probably going help growth hormone subsequently IGF-1
levels, will help older age groups younger age groups. - like


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

science. [energetic music]


eat dinner. me, means sometime around six seven o'clock, sometimes
eight o'clock. confess last night, 'cause working late, ate pretty big,
basically meal day, 10 o'clock. rare thing me. Can still
achieve high degree growth hormone output if, say avoid food two
three hours going sleep? one deep fast order
achieve increase growth hormone? - still pretty good growth hormone
output even eat two three hours sleep. just law diminishing
returns, longer go, get slightly slightly more. - Right, know
number people think growth hormone context exogenous growth
hormone fact can, cases, associated cancers.
asked many times before, can increase growth hormone things like
saunas intermittent fasting cause levels growth hormone high
cause cancers. impulse say, no, seems like not like happen,
probably verify statement you. - Yeah, quite unlikely. think growth
hormone, especially IGF-1. actually IGF-1 IGF-2. think
terms endocrine IGF-1, mostly IGF-1 synthesized liver
released liver versus IGF-1 released classically. example
IGF-1 levels increase resistance training exercise.
like paracrine autocrine, local action. IGF-1, pretty well
studied just give people IGF-1, not going to, physiologic levels, not
going improve body composition. However, IGF-1 autocrine
paracrine just working local tissues muscles likely part reason
get improved body composition response exercise. - see, just clarify
others, can say major functions IGF-1 IGF-2
distinct just growth hormone? just kind active hormone growth
hormone? kind pickaxe end assembly line? - Yeah.
much longer duration action. believe half-life IGF-1 several days almost
week, whereas growth hormone extremely fast half-life hours. growth
hormone acts significantly liver produce IGF-1. around

00:29:08 Sleep Quality & Hormones

serum blood long enough producing effect pretty much
time. - interesting. - Yep. - Well, pillars, stress, talked


lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug

lot stress podcast tools managing stress. Sleep obviously
big one. think, nothing else, will either put people sleep podcast.
Certainly not one, solo episodes hopefully convince people sleep
foundation mental physical health performance. aspects
hormone optimization can improve sleep? know sleep can improve hormone
optimization, aspects hormonal optimization can improve sleep?
people suffering common syndrome going sleep
waking 03:00 04:00 morning, know can associated
depression, hormonal indications might lead kind
situation? - Yeah, three big ones. first one not super common,
direct correlation. growth hormone deficiency, true deficiency,
whether adult child, sleep likely going affected.
say child growth hormone deficiency, replaced therapy,
sleep going get significantly better. second one common
scenario called vasomotor symptoms menopause
vasomotor symptoms andropause also applicable.
progestogenic activity, main progestogens progesterone
pregnenolone 5-alpha, 3-alpha-progesterone, is- -
manufactured body? - manufactured places. men,
manufactured testes Leydig cells. women, manufactured
ovaries menopause. also manufactured adrenal gland.
pre-adrenopausal adrenal glands still working fairly well,
usually still decent amount progesterone around, can measured
too. menopause, women make progesterone ovaries, sorry,
adrenal glands. progesterone crosses blood-brain barrier, especially
5-alpha 3-alpha reduced, modified little bit, GABA agonist,
helps sleep just like GABA does, gamma-amino butyric acid, main inhibitory
neurotransmitter lots things work on, alcohol works GABA well.
Gabapentin also works GABA. Migraine medicines, many work GABA.
Benzodiazepines, also non-benzos. example benzo Xanax.
example non benzo Ambien. work GABA. GABA also
helped progestogenic activity well. lot women menopause
feel like sleep much worse lower activity
progestogens. - men so-called andropause, low testosterone, also one


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug

science. [energetic music]


causes poor sleep. - Low testosterone can lead poor sleep, nut third
scenario actually, man begins TRT, develop poor sleep sleep
apnea. drastically raises risk somebody going sleep apnea.
lot people, especially first started first month two, puts
hypersympathetic state, overactive androgen
receptors, especially long time hypogonadal.
physiologic dose TRT causes sleep issue itself. - Interesting, lot
questions TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. just mention
say increases sympathetic activity, don't mean taking testosterone
increases sympathy others. may fact opposite. Although clear
discussions colleagues endocrinology side also
great Dr. Robert Sapolsky increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing
features people. jerks become bigger jerks, kind people become even
kind general, want get TRT depth, interesting hear
testosterone replacement therapy increases risk sleep apnea. want
make sure ask also case people using TRT not
hypogonadal? classic situation, somebody isn't making enough
testosterone, 300 nanograms per deciliter chart, go take
TRT. many people nowadays, honest, taking doses testosterone even
though sort standard range, range large
symptomology, right? - Yeah, love analogy Dr. Sapolsky
monks taking testosterone making generous.
appear testosterone usually does, exacerbates, will,
previously like. not going change person.
eugonadal start testosterone- - Meaning? - Meaning normal
testosterone, start TRT self-administered TRT, steroids, however
want look it, risk sleep apnea still goes dose-dependent
fashion. higher dose, risky. sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic fight flight nervous system,
parasympathetic rest digest.

00:35:03 Testosterone Women

much fight flight, stress can cause too, not


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


going rest well night. - want touch testosterone women
testosterone women. like know testosterone comes from,
tissues, like know whether not testosterone replacement therapy make sense
women. hearing women using testosterone. like
know whether not knowing woman's testos, know testosterone
equal, less value knowing, instance, progesterone estrogen
levels? think lot misconceptions roles testosterone
women. - health optimization, testosterone just important know.
pathology prevention, example, breast cancer, osteoporosis, estrogen,
progesterone important know. thinking women,
women think tiny amount testosterone, test it,
people test free testosterone, testosterone unbound, far
smallest proportion testosterone. androgen bound lots different
steroid-binding proteins. ones pertinent called SHBG, sex
hormone-binding globulin. binds androgenic steroid, example, DHT
dihydrotestosterone. associated prostate enlargement, associated male
pattern baldness. binds strongly, binds testosterone next
strongly, binds things like androstenedione DHEA,
dehydroepiandrosterone. binds estrogens, weakest, like estradiol.
look total amount testosterone, women actually have, almost women,
not women, almost significantly testosterone estradiol,
different measurements. estradiol, lot time picograms
per mil opposed nanograms per deciliter. women testosterone
estrogen significantly DHEA either. - Interesting. women make
dihydrotestosterone? - Yeah. - testosterone come from?
don't testes. - Yeah, testosterone women premenopausal
can come theca cells, T-H-E-C-A. theca cells cells ovaries can
produce testosterone. lot people actually heard hyperthecosis, not
term itself. lot Olympians are, chromosomes XY,
females, not taking any- - Wait, XY, females? - sorry,
XX. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Thank you. XX, not XY,
never transitioned sort hormone replacement testosterone,
naturally produce huge amount testosterone, much many men.
women, believe Botswana, banned competing


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly

science. [energetic music]


Olympics certain distances. believe banned 400 meter 800
meter, natural testosterone deemed high. -
mistakenly thought using steroids? - actually knew not
using steroids. knew theca cells just genetically gifted, suppose.
still made change distances. - [Andrew] Wow. - one two
athletes changed to, believe 3K 5K, still quite well,
not best event. - Interesting, yeah, turning interesting
controversial area notion hormone therapies natural variation
hormones different chromosomal backgrounds. Fascinating, probably

00:38:55 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss

whole episode that, 'cause much times. men women
make DHT. like ask DHT men. often hear testosterone
men free testosterone unbound form course. dihydrotestosterone,
come men? cascade events takes testosterone
dihydrotestosterone quote/unquote positive negative
effects of, referring endogenous dihydrotestosterone. fact,
make clear whether not talking taking something one's natural
production. just, think now just talking natural
production. tell us DHT men, powerful hormone development
obviously. doing? - DHT androgenic hormone. whether
talking DHEA, weak androgen, testosterone, relatively
strong androgen, DHT, strong androgen, bind androgen
receptor men women. effect three mediated
androgen receptor. couple different beta-estradiol receptors alpha-
estradiol receptors, one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, X
chromosome, men get androgen receptor gene mother. Women get
one androgen receptor gene father, one mother. Often one
sensitive androgens people PCOS, one active.
one methylated inactive. - Can just pause one second? Sorry
interrupt, ask question forget. know number people
probably wondering, heard whether not one develops male pattern
baldness, whether not male develops male pattern baldness, just precise,


get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

get information looking mother's father,
would, keeping just described, X chromosome, course
handed off mother, carrying genes encode number
distribution androgen receptors DHT will bind to, 'cause course, think
probably tell us, DHD responsible male pattern bald beard growth,
right? look grandfather mother's side determine
likely look like terms DHT-ness, word? - Yeah, best guess
make purely phenotypes. Now can measure genotype
get better idea that. Assuming true male pattern baldness, related
gene transcription androgen receptor. like think much
androgen receptor gene activated androgen? extremely
sensitive gene, usually means CAG repeats, basically
just certain, CAG encodes certain amino acid,
repeats, androgen receptor gene works better. Think corollary
Huntington's disease of, called trinucleotide repeats,
not severe disease, get CAG repeats,
way are, population getting CAG repeats, natural
selection process ongoing variety number reasons.
anyway repeats, gene activates cytoplasm moves
nucleus causes gene transcription often hair loss often. -
mean seeing hair loss now due elevated levels DHT
50 years ago? - Probably not. hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years
ago, 500 years ago, probably significant, average, 500 years
ago, people sensitive androgens. syndrome called androgen
insensitivity syndrome, AIS syndrome related men,
copy mother carrier, AR gene, androgen receptor gene,
completely insensitive. think it, not related CAG repeats, think
receptor just not working all. continuum, everybody's receptor
works little bit better little bit worse. better receptor works,

00:43:46 DHT Men Women, Turmeric/Curcumin, Creatine

likely male pattern baldness. - zoom this, still
keeping eye DHT, like see women men optimize


DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's

DHT? talking regardless age. still puberty
onward phase. haven't yet micro-dissected decade decade, will do,
like see people keep DHT check? tell us that,
tell us positive things DHT proper range? - Yeah,
DHT helps lot for, reason testosterone helps, activates antigen
receptor gene. helps effort feel good. can motivating. active
CNS. also active cardiovascular tissue. look someone
heart failure someone cardiac hypertrophy, level DHT can matter
also binding androgen receptor myocardium heart
itself. think classic bodybuilder heart. easy example make.
thickened muscle. muscle strong, pumping blood
often high blood pressure DHT testosterone DHT
derivatives like Masteron oxandrolone, preamble also bind heart,
cause even hypertrophy enlargement muscle tissue. say
person stops recovering, trying cardiac remodeling,
take thick heart, cardiac remodeling's important lot
different cardiac pathologies, give finasteride dutasteride, inhibit
enzyme can converts testosterone DHT, making less activity
androgen receptor gene, cardiac remodeling, heart health improves.
- see, non-body builder, typical woman man, younger older,
sorts things support DHT, thereby heart health? Presumably DHT involved
things testosterone famous men women.
Things like libido, mentioned, making effort feel good. motivation, drive
vitality is, guess, general phrase. sorts things support DHT?
sorts things create problems DHT? - lots dietary changes
supplementation probably right now affecting DHT. -
mean personally? - Well, everybody. listeners. say
diet high plant polyphenols, many inhibit enzyme converts
testosterone DHT. - give us example one those, either
supplementation form, food form? - Curcumins, certain curcuminoids, depending
structure, will inhibit enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone
DHT. - Turmeric? - Yeah. Turmeric. Black pepper extract. used often
increase bioavailability. also called BioPerine. also 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.
top that, people different genetics too. people, 5-alpha-


reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

reductase enzymes, three them. chromosome two, three, four,
believe, active prostate, active
brain. depends tissue, tissue-specific enzymes depend
much DHT convert. - recommend people avoid curcumin
turmeric reason? specific recommendations men versus
women. - man woman, way, women, lot times, just ask
doctor DHT check, units men, essentially undetectable.
to, especially oral contraceptives, front topic, DHT
likely undetectable, especially free DHT. can measure DHT
free DHT. someone's DHT already low, somewhat insensitive
androgen receptor via genetics via lifestyle, recommend avoid bioavailable
curcuminoids like bioavailable turmeric, black pepper extract, might good
candidate creatine. Creatine, like creatine monohydrate, can significantly increase
conversion testosterone DHT. - Interesting, also lot really interesting
data coming now role creatine brain fuel, maybe even
cognitive enhancer time. data still ongoing, studies
humans pretty impressive, least me. glad mentioned thing
curcumin black pepper. wish conversation six years ago,
experience jumping bandwagon excitement around turmeric,
took turmeric supplement. couple capsules thought be,
think high quality turmeric, never felt poor subsequent
days, flat line of, just say everything one want life, energy,
vitality, just cliff. friend somehow knew curcumin inhibit 5-alpha
reductase. converts testosterone DHT, pointed out. stopped taking it,
new addition diet supplementation, things bounced back
within three, four days. remarkable. mean, felt like garbage.
actually kind frightening experience sharpness cliff. know
people like turmeric antiinflammatory properties, et cetera. Sounds like
people either need experiment, do, obviously approach caution.
Anytime add remove something, need talk doctor. doctor,
guessing one experiment, say
effects things like curcumin reversible me?
potential permanent damage people taking long time?



00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds

00:50:10 5-Alpha Reductase, Finasteride, Saw Palmetto

- effects nearly always reversible talking 5-alpha reductase
inhibition, turmeric does, stronger. common story hear
regarding supplement known saw palmetto, lot older men take
prostate health finasteride, can take prostate, heart,
hair, dutasteride. side effects these, probably
couple different reasons. One can ratio androgens estrogens off,
needs addressed. Another one can inhibiting conversion
progesterone type progesterone, 5-alpha, 3-alpha, talked
earlier helping sleep brain, calmness.
definitely effect. Another one depending type supplement med,
inhibit different isoenzymes 5-alpha reductase. just inhibiting one
two, going different effect inhibiting two three.
finasteride two three, saw palmetto one two, dutasteride
three. third one active brain dutasteride inhibits third one
little bit weaker vivo, strongly vitro. really hard parse out. can use
biofeedback experimentation. think supplements safe experiment.
time takes set usually three months. risk of,
anecdotally, lots research published post-finasteride syndrome
real fake. real, one things combination organic
inorganic disease. Almost kind like fibromyalgia definitely real,
lots things can help it, unlikely occur stop
taking supplement medication side effects. - Interesting, well,
certainly feel better taking five grams creatine monohydrate per day. know
people take muscle growth tissue repair things sort, mainly
think brings water muscle tissue, et cetera, take brain effects,
also like think gives

00:52:30 Hair loss, DHT, Creatine Monohydrate

little bit DHT bump can actually see blood charts done them.
know many people want avoid hair loss can sometimes associated
DHT levels going high. asked many times, creatine


monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

monohydrate cause hair loss? make sense creatine increases DHT
DHT binding androgen receptor scalp can induce hair loss,
case. true people just overly concerned something
trivial non-existent? - male fem, yes, can potentially add it. don't like
say causes it, can little bit fuel fire. just like everybody
different sensitivity androgen receptor, different amount gene
transcription going cause death follicle. arbitrary threshold.
don't really know start losing hair. - somebody takes little bit
creatine increase DHT, maybe cognitive enhancing effects,
whatever reason, notice bit hair falling sink, stop
taking it, said death follicle, sounds dramatic. little stem
cell niches reside follicle, hairs grow from, abolished, like
no going back, can one rescue hair? - takes months, still
there, hair will come back. loss hair normal part hair
cycle. antigen phase, catagen phase, telogen phase,
hair loss, new follow. - stem cell niche hair follicle. -
Yeah. Yeah. Think like sharks teeth. shark loses tooth,
new one comes through. losing baby tooth, new one,
hair just always keeps coming through. natural die lose.
start 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, often big shed.
happens big shed cells unhealthy,
immediately jettison hair start making much healthier new follicle.
lot hairs end telogen phase,
called telogen effluvium, also happens pregnancy, also happens thyroid
pathologies. shed it, new one place, think
horrible hair loss caused finasteride whatever doing. minoxidil
too, really just new, healthier follicle. go really long
time, go year,

00:55:07 Hair Regrowth, Male Pattern Baldness

hairs might come back, might not. - simplicity's sake,
somebody concerned about, experiencing hair loss, male female,
options ways offset hair loss not going negatively impact


tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost

synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen

oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,

tissues sensitive DHT? basically saying is, imagine taking
DHT inhibitor, pill sort, injection sort, offsetting hair loss,
maybe even stimulate hair growth. clear not that, know
people do, experience negative effects blunting DHT,
reduced affect, reduced libido, reduced drive, disruptions prostate function, even
sexual function generally. can people want maintain grow back
hair, don't want effects? avoid
perhaps consider talking doctor about? - Yeah, whole host
options. try separate alopecia hair loss two different categories, male pattern
baldness, androgenic alopecia, also known androgenetic alopecia, versus
types alopecia, usually telogen effluvium. androgenetic alopecia male
pattern baldness, even female, perhaps say PCOS, something like that,
want sort strategy decrease activity androgen receptor. -
women can get male pattern baldness? - [Kyle] Absolutely. - Okay, going
wrap head around one, okay. - lot different things
can topical. promising called dutasteride mesotherapy.
Essentially localized injections areas prone male
pattern baldness, whether female male. acts locally only.
repeat injections time time, decreases conversion testosterone
DHT just scalp. - can avoid prostate effects.
negative effects blocking D HT females, periphery? Meaning not scalp
brain? DHT stuff? - Yeah, DHT, also
5-alpha, 3-alpha progesterone, called THP dihydroprogesterone
tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone. active central nervous system,
also just active, again, binding androgen receptor female well, causing
effort feel good, motivation. lot women sensitive DHT,
'cause women can sensitive DHT well, feel different start oral
contraceptive, not alters DHT huge amount. degree.
negative feedback inhibition pituitary less produced
ovaries, increases SHBG really high.

00:58:12 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Inositol, DIM

SHBGs significantly higher, free DHT way lower. - see,


woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug

woman know PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome?
issues polycystic ovarian syndrome? can done PCOS? confess,
naive PCOS. wasn't supposed rhyme, since does, confess
completely naive it. started getting lot questions various
forums. think actually reason initially approached you. know
treated lot PCOS. age women PCOS, PCOS?
Teach us PCOS, please. - Yeah, PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome.
one conditions underdiagnosed. prevalence much
higher think is. lot studies. studies say
prevalence 10%, say 20%. not completely clinically penetrant.
people don't know PCOS infertility subfertility. -
PCOS happening frequency 20-year old women, 30-year old women, 40
onward? - women find PCOS 30s, especially,
spectrum continuum, like lot things, can weaker version,
severe version. - symptoms? - criteria called Rotterdam
criteria. Rotterdam criteria, couple different ways can
diagnose it. looking androgen excess, insulin resistance, also
look polycystic ovaries. don't actually polycystic ovaries get
ultrasound ovaries diagnosed. androgen excess, example,
androgenic acne, hormonal acne. hair growth, like hair growth
chin, called hirsutism. have, like deepening voice, symptom
much. male pattern baldness, female, symptom PCOS well.
can also insulin resistance. obesity. pre-diabetes, high
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR two, fasting insulin six.
significant insulin resistance also androgen dominance, sign it. Androgen
dominance often leads called oligomenorrhea.
35-day intervals period less nine per year, can
sign oligo, means little, menorrhea means menses.
common sign PCOS. infertility, age
35 trying year, age 35,
trying six months, can also be, common
presenting complaint somebody presents PCOS. - assuming
woman things paying attention six pillars talked
earlier, diet, exercise, caloric restriction, cases, right? Not everyone


needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

needs caloric restricted. Stress, sleep, sunlight, spirit. Assuming
things, things realm diet supplementation can help
avoid PCOS subclinical PCOS not developed it, don't
want develop it? 'Cause doesn't sound like good thing. - Yeah, depending
are, strong insulin resistance spectrum, optimizing
body composition, decreasing body fat, treating metabolic syndrome
can help. lot people ask, well, everybody on, like everybody
need metformin PCOS? Not necessarily, metformin one
tools can help insulin sensitization. tools can help inositol,
myo-inositol insulin sensitizer. cousin D-chiro-inositol weak antiandrogen.
lot types inositol it. depending female
male inositol, type inositol matter. - Yeah,
important point. Just today said trying new supplement inositol role
perhaps enhancing sleep even further. sleep's generally pretty good. Lately
little bit off number reasons. took first time last night, said,
thought helped, just subjectively, said, "What kind inositol it,
inositol potent androgen inhibitor. turns taking myo-inositol,
not androgen inhibitor. type mentioned, androgen
inhibitor is? - D-chiro-inositol. usually ratio 1 25 1 40, much lower
amount compared myo-inositol. - supplement body? - supplement
help induce ovulation. - women PCOS might want try
reduce androgen, perhaps want take form inositol reduce
androgen receptor activity. Correct? - Yeah. want both. woman
ever talked doctor getting oral contraceptive
spironolactone, also anti-androgen, happens potassium-sparing
diuretic blood pressure medicine well. D-chiro-inositol might better option. DIM
diindolylmethane another kind

01:04:00 Oral Contraception, Perceived Attractiveness, Fertility

weak antiestrogen, antiandrogen lot women consider well. -
mentioned oral contraception. done posts these. just call them,
really perceptual effects whereby demonstrated humans several times
now, appeared solid studies women take oral


contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body

contraceptives, shift perception men, 'cause studies
looked heterosexual, sort arrangements here, women oral
contraception, blunts peaks valleys hormone output, no
longer experience peak valleys assessment men's
attractiveness. sort flattens perception, speak. still find certain
men attractive certain men unattractive, degree difference kind
mellowed out. likewise, men, data say men perceiving women's
attractiveness, still see women oral contraceptives attractive, woman
taking oral contraception eliminates kind peak attractiveness men
otherwise perceive. words, oral contraceptives changing way
perceive other, least terms male/female experiments.
going that? oral contraceptives, blunt increase
testosterone occurs just ovulation, complex cascade?
going on? find fascinating. - Yeah, differences your,
wouldn't use word change necessarily, alter severity alter peak,
said. just like TRT not going change person, oral contraceptive will
not change person. will just change day day peaks troughs
libido attractiveness. one main effects oral contraceptives, almost
synthetic estrogen synthetic progestogen them. One common type
synthetic estrogen ethanol estradiol. another new synthetic estrogen
well, anecdotally, seems even side effects.
ethanol estradiol 100 times potent endogenous bioidentical estradiol
liver. binds estrogen receptor liver, going increase sex
hormone-binding globulin, secondarily, mentioned, decreases free
testosterone, especially free DHT. little testosterone hump get
female ovulating, really flatlined pretty insignificant
difference. not negligible, little bit hump significantly less
oral contraceptive. - blunt associated
increase libido normally occur increase androgen? - Yes. -
Yeah. Interesting. forms contraception, right? 'Cause are,
copper IUD, various implants. rings, huge number
different forms these. talking is, understand,
effect oral contraception impacts hormone output. correct? - Yeah,
lot effects well. example, choice synthetic progestin will alter


high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157

less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

high platelets SHBG go. appears higher platelets
higher SHBG, higher risk blood clot. lot women know
oral contraceptive already predisposed blood clot
venous thromboembolism, vein blood clot either leg,
lung, can increase chance. can choose synthetic progestin
not going high response, various pros cons.
synthetic progestins weak anti-androgens well. example, one known
Slynd, made spironolactone. women spironolactone
well, made spironolactone, probably isn't particularly
necessary unless need diuretic hypertensive effect. - see, just
going intentionally interrupt, apologize, specifically wanted ask
about, notion oral contraception taken long periods time can
disrupt fertility ways independent just age-related decrease fertility.
true? - depends mean long time. 6 12 months, possible.
Past that, seems unlikely. However, persistently elevated SHBG can
present quite time. - Wait, woman takes oral contraception 6 12
months stops, will essentially aware would've anyway
terms fertility age? saying can cause permanent
damage? - fertility equitable never taken certainly
12 months, probably six months off. - she... know women
taken oral contraception many years are, addition age-related decline
fertility occurs inevitable, course slope going different depending
individual, quickening transition infertility? - Probably not,
make case oral contraceptive, may
slightly predisposed insulin resistance and/or lower lean body mass.
probably going negligible difference compared resistance training
also caloric restriction caloric maintenance so- - course also
effects children. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, mean parameters, right?
'Cause major lifestyle shift, right?

01:10:31 Testosterone & Marijuana Alcohol

obviously people contend since beginning human time
anyway. want ask questions male hormone therapy male hormones


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


generally. that, couple burning questions get often
just going insert now. Marijuana, heard can decrease testosterone
men women. heard can increase testosterone. Alcohol, think
general consensus high alcohol intake, high barbiturate intake fact reduce
testosterone. modest increase alcohol? not drinker, not
asking questions me. don't smoke pot, whatever. just never really liked
marijuana alcohol. not thing. many people want know answers
these. data seen confused conflicting,
marijuana, reduce testosterone significant degree not? - Cannabinoids
itself, whether THC CBD, not going reduce testosterone themself.
smoked marijuana, likely increase aromatase, increases
estrogen. going to, aromatizing testosterone. going
decrease testosterone. increased estrogen, like estradiol,
going work pituitary make less hormones cause release
testosterone. going less LH less FSH. almost kind like
opiates well known to, opiate agonists, going decrease LH FSH
subsequently testosterone. Smoked marijuana will well. far alcohol, high
alcohol will decrease testosterone will potent GABA agonist, whether
barbiturate, benzodiazepine, non-benzo alcohol, definitely going to.
Moderate alcohol, guess depends definition is. American
Heart- - guess thinking like, people know don't seem alcoholics,
least assessment, will glass two wine four nights week,
seems like tremendous amount, don't like alcohol. don't
problem people liking alcohol, think many people
considered low moderate intake. - Yeah, consider low intake.
American Heart Association men recommends one two drinks day
average. - recommend it? - around, yeah. around one per week. - Wait,
making heart less healthy not drinking alcohol. - Yeah, recommend
low amount alcohol intake men. women, recommend zero one.
kind hard interpret, zero one. protective effect alcohol, especially
red wine polyphenols it, outweighs deleterious effect. - Interesting,
'cause seen studies point idea even low intake alcohol
prolonged period time might actually decrease brain volume least volume
particular brain areas. course don't know consequence decreasing


volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

volume given brain area either. mean, one can imagine decreasing size
one's amygdala making less stressed. Although no evidence support
that. told need drink many, many times, always reply don't
need drink anything order speak mind. again, individual differences.
interesting, sounds like smoked marijuana may fact reduce testosterone
least increase conversion testosterone estrogen, correct? - Yeah. - Okay. -
alcohol GABA agonists, important remember shouldn't daily.
one drink alcohol day actually mildly immunosuppressive. better
two drinks alcohol one day week two drinks

01:14:27 Sleep Supplement Frequency

alcohol another day week no alcohol rest time.
said even supplements GABA them. lot sleep supplements
gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA, so- - Yeah, occasionally take, oh,
sorry interrupt. occasionally take 100 200 milligrams GABA order enhance
sleep. maybe every third four nights. No three four nights
week. - Yeah. - Yeah. - perfect. - Okay. - lot sleep supplements
not taken daily GABA's one them. Another one
Trazodone. melatonin kind arguable depends situation.
general, taking sleep supplement, not taken every night. -
sleep supplements understand okay take every night nearly every night
things like magnesium 3 8, apigenin, not true, correct me. certainly take
every night unless forget back home traveling. - Magnesium's one
exceptions. L-theanine also another exception. - Great, well least
haven't put anything world wrong category yet.

01:15:34 Testosterone Supplementation & Prostate Cancer

hopefully won't. do, correct myself. talk testosterone
males. see headlines times now testosterone levels dropping,
sperm counts dropping. Phenotypes men changing time. can't quite
follow literature that, obviously hard controlled experiments
do, techniques change time, sensitivity techniques change


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

will open question answer format ask questions,


will best answer real time. Thank joining
today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


time. regardless, aware lot people considering increasing
testosterone taking testosterone. years ago considered steroid use,
really extreme kind stance. Nowadays seems like discussion
it. First off like know testosterone supplementation, talking
prescription doctor, make one prone prostate cancer?
seems always first question comes out. - Yeah, huge
amount misinformation too. testosterone not going cause prostate
cancer. However, normal aging causes prostate cancer testosterone will grow
prostate cancer. 80-year-old male autopsy
least say 50% percent chance prostate cancer, 90 100 years
old, least 90% chance. humans prostate, matter
time get prostate cancer. begs question, want take
something going grow sure it? individual
assessment important follow things like PSAs well. - PSA four
less, mean, ideally wouldn't four, 'cause kind upper threshold,
simplest read whether not excessive prostate growth.
benign prostate hyperplasia prostate growing, non-cancerous,
correct? course symptomologies, like people challenges
urination, sexual difficulties, et cetera. always struck correlation
people draw testosterone prostate health fact that,
say claim testosterone makes prostate health worse. think
it, young males high testosterone often, not always, certainly often.
don't see lot prostate overgrowth cancer young males. something's going
here. conceptualize this? - PSA 3.9
25-year-old male versus 75-year-old male PSA 5.9, 3.9 PSA
significantly concerning. think prostate taking cumulative damage
from, not testosterone, also estrogen also growth hormone.
obese individuals higher incidences prostate cancer well,
don't cell checkpoints immune system takes second says,
right, stop replicating fast prostate cells. see atypical ones
finds prevents reproducing. immunotherapy
cancer promising can target certain things. older male
going cumulative damage happen already arguably prostate cancer
normal, aging, fast aging abnormal. slow aging normal. fine


line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

line walk two. lot things can done decrease
turnover, decrease inflammation, decrease congestion prostate
time. also lot just PSAs can done. prostate
MRIs things like can look structure function prostate. -
every male maintain health prostate? realize
younger males probably aren't thinking all. Although seems like nowadays
get kind call cryptic questions. think women comfortable
talking hormone sexual health cycle,
menstrual cycles. used fluctuations sort give experience
like different levels progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, et cetera.
get kind cryptic questions often direct messages think
people asking is, something wrong prostate?
prostate? often indirect questions

01:20:24 Prostate Health, Dietary Fiber, Saw Palmetto, C-Reactive Protein

aspects life suffering. don't say ingest. think
direct discussion great. males maintain prostate
health throughout lifespan? - Maintaining prostate health can looked similarly
can maintain good natural optimal testosterone. look things
can hurt it. don't necessarily look one thing can improve boost it.
young males, prostatitis, goes hand hand epididymitis. different
infections prostate. younger male is, likely related
something sexually transmitted. another common cause
call gram negative anerobic bacteria. prostate right end
colon. chronic constipation colitis you, even just E-
coli overgrowth colon likely cause infection prostate well. -
males prevent that? - diet good, healthy prebiotic
fiber, probiotics well. Make sure regular bowel movements,
don't chronic constipation. good sources dietary fiber, also
soluble fiber, enough insoluble fiber. people get enough insoluble non-
dietary fiber. can help prevent chance diverticulitis, another type
infection. can also decrease chance colitis decrease chance
prostate infections well. - foods and/or supplements men


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

science. [energetic music]


take avoid? about, hear saw palmetto, yeah, supplements for,
supplements support cause issues prostate? - Yeah, strong
genetic predisposition enlarged prostates, even just really early prostate cancers
grow fast, consider taking saw palmetto even curcumin
anti-androgen, long able tolerate it. individualized basis
depends history. far making sure prostate not congested,
interesting correlation girls prostate cancer. -
girl offspring? - Yeah. - offspring females, slightly
likely prostate cancer. hypotheses link estrogen prostate cancer
rather testosterone. hypoestrogenism, prostate
atypical cells. general, higher C-reactive protein, general marker
inflammation body, call CRP, test order hsCRP, high-
sensitivity CRP. CRP raises high, autoimmune disease,
like Crohn's flare lupus infection sexually
transmitted infection, even colitis, even flu, CRP going raise
significantly. - detect blood test course. - Correct. Yeah. - Yeah. -
want get baseline CRP haven't things recently.
CRP higher, also female offspring. CRP higher,
reactive oxygen species, causing mutations atypical cell
turnover

01:24:05 Prostate Health & Pelvic Floor, Viagra, Tadalafil

prostate also likely higher. want keep low CRP. - Interesting,
blood flow, pelvic floor general? probably whole
episode pelvic floor. much interesting data coming fields
clinical research urology. realize kind Netherlands biology
medicine. People probably aren't thinking much this, pelvic floor
obviously confluence ton vasculature, nerves, course prostate
resides there. course genitals reside well. imagine
one six pillars, exercise, able maintain adequate blood flow
regions key. just postural things? People sitting much, not hydrating
well enough, mentioned avoiding constipation. things,
including medications can serve support prostate time maybe even


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

science. [energetic music]


support pelvic floor general, males females time? - Absolutely,
something rightfully getting attention. way explain
pelvic floor abdominal cavity, includes peritoneum
organs are, retroperitoneum, pelvic space. Think box.
abs front box. back muscles back. diaphragm top
box. pelvic floor, port outside world. Especially
important, muscles well. can exercises. Pelvic floor physical
therapists becoming utilized, especially childbirth,
situations well, including men getting care urologists. want
strengthen pelvic pelvic floor make sure tubes docked
outside world working well enough, not loose. not working
well. lot medications can positives negatives pelvic
floor. kind talked gut colon health general. far
prostate health far bladder urinary system health, think
couple different classes. phosphodiesterase. tadalafil.
Basically going help decrease congestion prostate. lot people take
ED, can actually help decrease your- - define that? - lot men
take tadalafil, generic Cialis, much longer half-life Viagra Levitra.
half-life almost day. can take low dose it. Instead taking 20
milligrams, take two two half milligrams. - saying lot men
take erectile dysfunction? - Yes. - lower doses, may served
purposes prostate health, independent erection? - Correct, common
scenario male waking twice night pee, average, it'll cut
once. waking four times night, can cut twice
night, just easier blood flow. used use medications like
Flomax, tamsulosin. alpha antagonist, basically binds
receptor smooth muscle, helps relax that. several alpha
antagonists. also medications hormonal like finasteride
lot people take prostate health decrease enlargement prostate.
periurethral area, periurethral lobe, several lobes prostate,
tends especially enlarged cases BPH and- - BPH? - Prostate hyperplasia
enlarged prostate. able shrink area, point, just
plumbing problem. urine able get easier. - Yeah, understanding
now growing, don't want say movement, [chuckles] idea


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

science. [energetic music]


taking low dose, like 2.5 milligram 5 milligram tadalafil, even daily becoming
pretty common many men not erectile dysfunction, simply either
maintain enhance prostate health. correct? - Yeah, correct. -
see negative effects that? - can negative effects. can lower
blood pressure. theoretically can increase chance vasovagal syncope. lot
people take alternative pump, kind works similarly citrulline,
different pump products pre-workout, can certainly help that.
go deadlift might pass anyway, can certainly increase
chance happens, don't compensatory exercise,
hypertension response. - someone just take away exercise? - could,
took tadalafil, going be, long half-life. Whereas Viagra
Levitra just hours, tadalafil almost today. interesting studies Viagra
done well. can potentially alter rays cones eye.
usual recommendation pilots need red-green discrimination
long distances small indicator lights not take Viagra. usually say
pilot profession, perhaps hold off while.
also studies Viagra significantly, also known sildenafil
generic now, can increase eyebrow hair growth. potentially helps
vasodilate relax veins, especially older men. veins
relaxed, better blood flow. one proposals theories behind
older men get androgenetic alopecia more. less blood flow
scalp. theoretically can also help prevent that, not going to- - theory,
increasing blood, oh, increases blood flow systemically throughout body?
- Yeah. - Not just specific tissues. Well, find incredibly interesting that, yeah,
online forums building now around low dose tadalafil, daily use low dose
tadalafil, again, not sexual erectile dysfunction, sake longterm prostate
health. reason women might want take low dose tadalafil? - tadalafil
also weak androgen receptor sensitizer, kind like L-carnitine, density
available androgen receptors bind increases slightly.

01:30:54 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

potentially benefit that, time used men. -
interesting, haven't really talked testosterone optimizing testosterone


males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

males. Assuming someone paying attention six pillars, kind gap
as, see it, things TRT, hormone replacement therapy.
again, R, replacement TRT little bit quotes nowadays, lot
people testosterone 300 900 nanogram per deciliter range opt
take low dose testosterone anyway. understanding
new kind movements area toward, instance, not big, large doses
injected infrequently, rather low doses quite frequently, obviously prescribed
doctor, monitored doctor, et cetera. generally like see
patients going take route? - hypogonadal patient whose
benefits outweigh risks TRT, want nice even steady state. not
going exactly producing pulsatile testosterone release endogenously
body. steady state, don't peak trough.
peak, antigen receptor gene overactive,
get erythropoietin EPO release, leads lot side
effects thick blood, higher hemoglobins, hematocrits.
crash, don't feel good. definitely not optimal. lot ways get
around this. testosterone replacement, someone
needs it, can different types esters, topical testosterone.
Ester basically something attached increase biological half-life.
common ones cypionate, enanthate, also short-acting
propionate, almost no clinical relevance. also long-acting
ones, decanoate, undecanoate, different mixtures those.
someone very, low SHBG, going trouble regulating
serum testosterone long run. topically, testosterone
absorbed, hopefully bound SHBG, lot times reapply twice daily
daily, lots variations. people, especially people
can't absorb well, not going great option. injections
preferred. people end injecting, either side effects
high, low, just much varied dose topical. also
capsule special lymphatic absorption. not absorbed liver,
not hepatically metabolized, absorbed lymph. essentially
testosterone undecanoate, put capsule. taken twice daily.
fairly steady half-lifes, take specific times day.
said, new enough isn't huge amount data it,


FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

FDA approved. brand name now. called JATENZO. injectables
general, lower SHBG, longer ester want, inject
it, whether intramuscular subcutaneous, just talk doctor risks
benefits those. Subcutaneous slightly longer active half-life,
esterases take longer reach supinate estered clavate. men, lot
people ask like usual dose is. people, total
100 120 per week actual replacement dose. - Milligrams? - Milligrams.
120 100 milligrams per week administered two three times per week. -
not, saying dividing two three, right? 'Cause sure bunch
people thinking, oh yeah, 103 times week, actually quite high
dose. Yeah, really seem shift toward spreading dosages
into,

01:35:17 Estrogen & Aromatase Inhibitors, Calcium D-Glucarate, DIM

dividing two three smaller doses. along lines, 5, 10 years
ago, common hear inhibiting estrogen aromatase inhibitors.
Nowadays hear, think true, least read literature,
inhibiting estrogen can disrupt brain function, can cause connective tissue issues,
even can cause reductions libido. lot people think estrogen, crash
estrogen, basically libido goes up, actually opposite often true. don't
want estrogen high low, correct? reason, shy away
people taking aromatase inhibitors? - Yeah, people truly need aromatase
inhibitor. almost always lifestyle interventions. can just depend gene,
active aromatase gene is. people's aromatase gene active. lot
times individuals pubertal gynecomastia, breast tissue growth
males, even despite no risk factor. - Even lean? - people get
lean. - remember growing up- - possible. - kids got
mild cases gynecomastia transient. Like sort like developed
gynecomastia went away. - Often unilateral one side too. growth
hormone lot times fuel fire. - Oh, interesting. - Yeah. - Yeah,
couple kids. mean, took teasing 'cause back then, wasn't online
discussions hormones things like that, seem transient.
were, people thinking actually lean individuals. weren't


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly

will best answer real time. Thank joining
today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


overweight, course can cause gynecomastia, adipose fat tissue can
convert testosterone estrogen. sounds like, except special cases,
avoiding aromatase inhibitors probably going good idea. - Yeah,
several ways can control estrogen keep healthy level,
check. lot patients assure
estrogen's going sky high actually low vice versa. calcium D-
glucarate supplement can help estrogen control. - typical dosage
calcium D-glucarate? - 500 1,000 milligrams. - risk
someone's estrogen normal range take supplement, estrogen
will go low? potent? - not potent. not near potent
aromatase inhibitor. helps excretion also sensitivity estrogen
receptor itself. kind like helps outcompete it. people will also take DIM
different cruciferous vegetable, get 'em cruciferous vegetables like kale but,
broccoli antiestrogen antiandrogen. TRT
that, probably just much TRT. - Yeah, remember
years ago friend, truly is, not like friend thing, 'cause
cautious just supplements take. think people might get impression
cavalier this, not. always alter one thing time. talk
physicians. suggest people actually done long period
time. recall wanting take DIM, 'cause thought, well, back hear,
okay, reduce estrogen. estrogen levels weren't range, fine,
thought, well, experience bringing down? someone
know quite informed area said, yeah, exactly said, DIM
can reduce estrogen, also testosterone. just never opted try take it.
want, sort airing direction, went straight six pillars TRT
people now call sports TRT, basically code language saying
taking exogenous testosterone even though one doesn't need get semi-super
physiological range high end, like 900 1,000 nanogram per deciliter range.
people always point out, mention that, oh, well certain countries, high end
range 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. US, 900. 1,200,
really super physiological?

01:39:28 Lifestyle Factors Increase Testosterone/Estrogen Levels, Dietary Fats



aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different

02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

aside, neglected ask gap individuals think
supplementation, meaning non-prescription approaches increasing
testosterone, probably also talk things like, true ice
baths increase testosterone not? Lifestyle factors go beyond six pillars
increasing testosterone. comment those, terrific.
Supplements useful. it'd wonderful mention
practices supplements might useful women well men
increase testosterone reasons talked earlier. - Yeah,
true individualized approach comes in. talking dose TRT
on, one thing keep mind law diminishing returns. Quality
life subjective thing different person. people
willing give little bit athleticism body composition. people
willing give up, not willing give libido sexual health. mentioned
earlier, everybody's androgen receptor less sensitive. can make
case somebody's androgen receptor half sensitive somebody else,
person less sensitive receptor need level 1,000 1,200. no
great way know that. can alter sensitivity androgen receptor
things like L-carnitine tadalafil mentioned. - definitely come back L-
carnitine, really intrigued data L-carnitine, women
men terms egg quality, sperm quality, fertility, bunch interesting
effects. come back L-carnitine. - lot feel, biofeedback
subjective, feel like this, comes ratio androgens estrogens.
lot lifestyle. someone's also hCG, upregulate aromatase
well. - hCG, might want just, human chorionic gonadotropin? - [Kyle] Yeah. Used
found pregnant, still found pregnant women's urine. - Still found pregnant
women, yeah. - used be, believe not, black market pregnant
women's urine stuff developed synthetically. words,
saying men typically buy pregnant women's urine black markets
order get hCG order get testosterone-enhancing effects hCG.
words, men using pregnant women's urine hCG. not want
got body. just skip going say next instead. - Yeah.
hCG. lot things upregulate estrogen. Alcohol significantly
increases aromatase. sensitive estrogen, probably shouldn't
even consume two glasses three times week. High fat meals also upregulate


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


aromatase. ketogenic diet, hyperestrogenism,
take care well. - kinds fats just saturated fats? - not sure
just saturated fats, fat definitely increases, fat body
consumption high amount calories increases aromatase. - ratio
testosterone estrogen. don't want break flow, since talking
fat, ask, since estrogen testosterone synthesized
cholesterol molecule, heard ingesting amount saturated fat can
useful way cholesterol can serve precursor molecules.
Now said podcast like butter much occasionally eat pats
butter. Somehow got misinterpreted mean eat entire many pats butter.
saying like one two pats butter there, no guilt shame
it. blood lipids great shape also, feel good. possible
people ingesting little saturated fats directly indirectly reduce
somehow disrupt proper ratio testosterone estrogen men women? -
theoretically possible, probably doesn't happen developed countries just like
theoretically possible not enough omega-6 fatty acids, probably not
happen developed countries. - don't need butter pats, going
anyway. just curious. - Yeah. - Okay. - Grass-fed butter good omega-3 content
well. grass-fed foods general. not end everybody doesn't
need grass-fed foods, one sources healthy trans fat.
naturally occurring trans fat comes ruminants. ruminants, think like cows
rumination different stomachs can change omega-3 omega-6
trans-linolenic trans-linoleic fatty acids. - healthy us. - Yeah.
actually omega-3s omega-6s just happened trans instead cis-
isomer. - healthy trans fats found ruminant cheese milk
butter ruminants meat- - meat. - meats? - Yes. -
people following purely plant-based diet mostly plant-based diet,
risk not getting enough certain types fats nutrients maintain
healthy ratio testosterone estrogen not? - vegetarian, probably
not risk. vegan, well risk. vegans aware
acutely supplement algae supplement
sources healthy fats. - see, takeaway drawing less
getting saturated fat, key get healthy trans fats ruminants. - [Kyle]
Yes. - food products ruminants well get proper amounts


omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

omega-3s. - Yeah, clear, don't need trans fats.

01:45:34 Aromatase Supplements: Ecdysterone, Turkesterone

just happens omega-3s omega-6s trans-isomer. - see, okay,
nutrition. supplements can support healthy testosterone estrogen
ratios? - Anything alters aromatase can support healthy testosterone estrogen.
testosterone estrogen ratio, think much estrogen activity
beta estradiol receptor alpha estradiol receptor. -
know that? - [chuckles] hard tell, depending eating,
lot plant-based diets polyphenols, many beta estradiol
receptors. People know Turkesterone also Beta-Ecdysterone, two
ecdysteroids beta estradiol receptor agonist. activate beta estradiol
receptor. low amount estrogen naturally, probably
better candidate it. - taking Turkesterone ecdysterone? - Yeah, ecdysterone. -
never tried them, know understanding work tremendously well
people. - Yeah. - not others. one just simply try.
promoting activity estrogen receptor, risk Turkesterone
ecdysterone cause quote/unquote problems associated
increasing estrogen activity, like reduced libido, water retention? - Water retention, yes.
Reduced libido, probably not. Closing growth plates bone, no,

01:47:04 Tongkat Ali (Long Jack), Estrogen/Testosterone levels

alpha-estradiol receptor. - talked couple podcasts
tongkat ali, Indonesian herb, guess, also made found Malaysia.
seems Indonesian variety tongkat ali effective
potentially reducing sex hormone binding globulin thereby freeing
testosterone. Whether not effects pathway, another
pathway, lot people report improvements things like libido maybe androgen-
like phenotypes, right? Feeling vital, et cetera. course,
placebo, correct? thoughts tongkat ali? please challenge
statements tongkat ali incorrect. not looking validation here.
just really want know thoughts it. ever recommend


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


patients, when? Men, women, one other? - Yeah, tongkat ali longjack
multiple mechanisms action several placebo controlled studies
it. show decrease SHBG, least one not show
change SHBG. However, act aromatase weakly. Probably not
strongly concerned hypoestrogenism. - reduces
aromatase thereby can reduce estrogen. - Correct. - Okay. - also weak, not
SERM, not selective estrogen receptor modifier, probably weak,
probably ERM well non-selective estrogen receptor modifier.
help decreasing negative feedback inhibition estradiol various locations
also increasing testosterone. - Interesting, yeah, dosage using
years now is, 400 milligrams taken day, typically early day, 'cause can
kind mild stimulant effect, mild. know products
recommend dosages much higher. Anytime taken 400,
don't feel good. don't know describe just little overly
stimulatory terms makes kind of, like drinking much coffee. - [Kyle] Yeah.
- interesting. women ever want take tongkat ali
reason? - Yeah, absolutely. lot women hyperestrogenism
unlike adrenal fatigue andropause, actually ICD 10 codes
hypoestrogenism. - ICD 10 codes? - Yeah. - doctor speak, right? - Yeah. - Okay. -
codes doctor can actually diagnose something.
go doctor say, adrenal fatigue, can't diagnose
that. say andropause, also can't diagnose that.
say hypoestrogenism, common complaint comes
endometriosis, overgrowth lining uterus. people
potentially, think, one area might see tongkat supplementation
more, not decrease aromatase. Like mentioned,
testosterone females higher estrogen females. lot females get
estrogen aromatization well. Peripheral estrogen sometimes call it,
not directly produced ovaries. good candidates
tongkat case. - interesting understanding people
looking sources Indonesian tongkat ali particular. - Correct. - Right. - Another
interesting application essentially a, call PCT, essentially- - means
is? - PCT means, defined post-cycle therapy. - Physicians love acronyms,
scientists love acronyms, military love acronym, we, yeah. PCT, post cycle therapy,


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

will best answer real time. Thank joining
today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


people coming off hormone therapy steroids. - actually
women coming off birth control pill, perhaps can help
lower SHBG back normal, sometimes persistently elevated,
can help prevent subsequent hypoestrogenism happens. - tongkat ali
need cycled? first started taking it, cycle it. few, three,
four months, take time off. Now just taking continuously
years. - [Kyle] Yeah. - say blood work check liver enzymes
everything else don't see reason cease taking it. - Yeah. Probably
not. human studies tongkat Fadogia. full disclosure,
help design Derek's new testosterone optimization supplement, Fadogia
agrestis also tongkat ali it. - Yeah. talk Fadogia separately
moment. say someone taking tongkat ali whatever reason,
need cycle off? - Likely not, just safe, affect
aromatase estrogen receptor modifier. -
reasonable cycle off? long take long stop taking again? -
Yeah, couple different protocols can do, 11 months on, 1 month off
tongkat pretty reasonable. Now guess is, talk later too,
combined Fadogia, protocol three weeks on,

01:52:25 Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency

one week off. - tongkat ali. curious thoughts Fadogia
agrestis, Nigerian shrub extract Nigerian shrubs least
experience, read literature, potential increase testosterone
probably hormones well way increasing luteinizing hormone. Something
haven't really talked much now. thoughts
Fadogia agrestis? ideas proposed mechanism mechanisms
might useful people off hormone replacement therapy? -
Yeah, Fadogia agrestis just reached point enough evidence till
know probably helps luteinizing hormone release, stimulates Leydig
cells testes produce testosterone. probably LH receptor
sensitivity well, good combination two. come
Nigerian shrub, not quite enough evidence able say safe
someone take time, again, full disclosure,


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

science. [energetic music]


recommended recommended people cycle supplement. three
weeks on, one week off, likely safe. toxicity studies general rats
humans, looks quite safe. - understanding toxicity studies rats
showed toxicity testicular cells, certainly concerning, dosages
used translating dosages used humans lead situation
dosages humans take very, large.
amount of, no longer take Fadogia, took 600 milligrams per day long
time. ceased taking experimenting things didn't
want confound things. Not negative side effects. fact,
monitoring blood work, biological parameters would've told
testicular toxicity, wasn't. put way. - Yeah. think
extremely safe. just not convinced enough overwhelming evidence
longterm consistent administration. - recommend people
not taking TRT recommend men women? - Yeah,
really high LH, probably gonadal issue, whether heat damage
testes, varicocele, history testicular cancer LH going higher.
LH already high, increasing even probably not going help.
However, LH low, obviously try find low? deficient
just little bit low? low don't issue prolactin, don't
issue opioid receptor antagonism, naltrexone can actually potentially help
antagonize increase LH well, especially people recovering opiates
likely even alcohol. looking subclinical secondary hypogonadism,
essentially, just think low LH. people lower LH
estrogen fine prolactin fine, Fadogia particularly good option. -
Interesting, three weeks on, one week off 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams
tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali potentially good. course,
everyone always check physician, clear this, blood work, et cetera.
always say don't just say protect us. say protect you, meaning
consumer. very, important. don't want get, don't want fly blind
stuff. want blood work, right? - catch-22
supplements safer medications, difference
medication one's prescribed one's not. - oftentimes
supplements, unclear whether not listed bottle actually
bottle but. - Yeah. - think number reputable brands now.



01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

01:56:44 Boron, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

supplement want talk terms testosterone augmentation
boron. boron thought do? actually that? ever
recommend boron? - Yeah, boron actually element. can find
periodic table. plentiful rich soils. frequent farming can deplete soils
boron. plentiful Mediterranean area like Greece Turkey, lot
people will just eat dates raisins grown there. - thought going tell
people eat dirt, people eat dirt. - people eat dirt. -
phenomenon called pica, right? people a, not good
thing, they- - Often assign iron deficiency. - Okay, eating grapes dates
grown soil high amounts boron. right? - Yeah. Yep,
boron can help regulate SHBG, effect mostly acute. unlikely
bad effect, lot people take boron probably not going hurt will
lower SHBG even short period time. guess make case
maybe cycling boron can help too. - sorts dosages useful boron
supplementation? - Three six milligrams twice day. - Oh, interesting,
higher amounts taking. long cocktail
tongkat ali, again, stopped taking Fadogia, long time Fadogia, boron,
think two four milligrams per day,

01:58:13 Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Fertility

maybe afford go higher. Although blood work want it,
thankfully. circling back Fadogia. Fadogia attractive supplement,
saw increases LH, testosterone, free testosterone. estrogen stayed
check, also not see down-regulation LH cycle off. Whereas
hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin, now arrive forms not
pregnant women's urine only, synthetic forms people inject, that,
understand, can actually suppress endogenous hormone output one takes
long period time. man woman want take hCG?
potential risks benefits taking hCG? - Yeah, hCG human chorionic
gonadotropin actually similar TSH. - Thyroid stimulating hormone? - Correct,


woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

woman pregnant, produces hCG, especially first trimester.
take pregnancy test, whether qualitative quantitative, see
hCG rise, actually doubles every 48 hours. five weeks pregnant,
can get hCG level. two days later, five weeks two days, can see
hCG, maybe went 500 1,000. precipitously increases.
things. One thing prevents hypothyroidism hypothyroxinemia pregnancy,
one common causes miscarriage. also are,
hypothyroidism get pregnant first trimester, want increase
dose 25 40% keep free T4 high much possible.
reason opposed somebody not
hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, likely thyroid will not respond
either TSH hCG. increased hCG not compensate that. take
hCG, can potentially improve thyroid function. along selenium
likely two best things can thyroid health. - hCG selenium? -
Yeah. - Well, definitely make sure get enough selenium eating three five Brazil
nuts per day. - Yeah. - much enjoy taste also. take hCG
can hCG suppress one's normal luteinizing hormone output? - Yeah, suppresses
LH dose-dependent manner. higher dose hCG take,
suppresses LH. common dose fertility, fertility usually hCG prescribed. -
men women? - both, 10,000 IUs one time, quite bit. -
tremendous dose. - Yeah, fact, formulations, brand names hCG come
autoinjector pins cannot even dose lower 5,000 units time. -
Wow. - Yeah. - know number people take hCG maintain testicular
function testosterone therapy augmentation sort. work
that? - Yeah, people hCG monotherapy. can slightly better
lipids TRT. - Oh, people using hCG alone kind neither sort
indirect hormone augmentation. - Yeah. clinics advertise non-
suppressive alternative TRT, suppressive LH. - also increase
estrogen pretty potently? - Yeah. - true increasing LH and/or hCG can
improve sensitivity genitals? true men women? Yeah,
heard anecdotally. People say hCG makes sexual activity pleasurable
people some, direct effect nerve cells genitals? -
Yeah, LH also agonist prostate genital tissue general.
common treatment post-finasteride syndrome post-5-alpha reductase


blocked conversion DHT long time, helps re-upregulate DHT. -
someone taking finasteride prevent hair loss, comes off it, maybe 'cause
felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end

felt lousy, feels even lousier reasons talked earlier.
might use hCG transition treatment transition back normal hormone
health. right? - Yeah. - extremely helpful many cases. Now come
off hCG, need strategy return normal fast
possible well. will upregulate 5-alpha reductase enzymes. have,
genital skin, scrotal skin penile skin, perineum general, have,
believe called stratum lucidum. skin layer very, thin,
highest concentration 5-alpha reductase. lot activity.
something inhibits enzyme, 5-AR enzyme tissues,
something else upregulate enzymes, whether waiting taking
time, whether trying tadalafil, whether trying creatine even, whether trying
HCG, lot times go-tos post-finasteride syndrome. - risks
women taking HCG ability get pregnant risks generally? - Yeah, obviously
it'll make pregnancy test positive. risk women don't know. -
one could, theory, fake pregnancy test injecting hCG. - Absolutely. - Interesting. -
Yeah. - no motivation that.

02:04:18 Prolactin & Dopamine, Pituitary Damage

just curious. [Kyle chuckles] - Yeah. - prolactin? simple version
taught, taught mainly neuroendocrine perspective
dopamine kind close cousin testosterone, also estrogen
matter, drives appetitive behaviors, including pursuit sexual partners, sex itself,
motivated behaviors generally, postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states
accompanied prolactin increase. refractory period mating males,
maybe even females well, involved milk letdown, et cetera. sort
general contours syndromes things people lookout
much prolactin little prolactin? aware number people
take dopamine agonists, L-tyrosine, cabergoline, things like that, really boost
dopamine levels. isn't always good thing turns out. Oftentimes
people become kind hyper-dopaminergic drive
appetitive things, fill blanks, don't always ability,


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -

science. [energetic music]


seems, just testosterone estrogen need proper ratios, dopamine
prolactin need appropriate ratios. think perhaps
act prolactin systems? - Absolutely, way describe dopamine wave
pool. increasing dopamine much, going overflow
going wave crash much. want nice even waves
not going far pool dopamine prolactin will follow.
prolactin estrogen quite close cousins. Estrogen upregulates gene called
PRL gene prolactin gene directly increases prolactin synthesis. prolactin
going also inhibit release testosterone pituitary. using
dopamine agonist, help decrease prolactin-producing cells, including
prolactin-producing microadenoma pituitary. - common
those? Because, mean, hear lot hypogonadism or, course
can due issue testicles hypergonadism also course like
ovarian syndromes course brain side signals aren't
coming brain. Not enough gonadotropin, not enough luteinizing hormone.
ways teasing apart endocrinologist quite elegant fact,
right? Using stimulating hormones, much dive here. often one
actually one pituitary tumors? heard people play lot
high contact sport, boxing, football, people headed soccer ball quite lot,
sadly people whose jobs force take head blows for, military.
firing 50 caliber guns kind woodpeckering brain inside
skull. construction workers just concussion can cause pituitary go
malfunctional. really common something rare like 1%? - Yeah,
extremely common. another one conditions lot people never
know it. just feel little bit fatigued. high prolactin
feeling time. Pituitary microadenomas can non-producing well.
prolactin can totally normal. growth hormone IGF-1 can totally normal.
second common producing microadenoma, growth hormone causing
either acromegaly, growth cartilage gigantism. - big brow. -
Yeah. - Yeah. - fairly common causes adenomas, lot people
small adenoma, much less one centimeter, hard see imaging
even contrast specifically looks pituitary many people aren't
symptomatic. one things along PCOS pre-diabetes
much frequent comes prevalence, amount,



02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people

02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

02:08:34 Augmenting Dopamine Levels: Casein, Gluten, Vitamin E, Vitamin B6 (P5P)

percentage people general population. - glad mentioned
dopamine wave pool. know nowadays lot interest augmenting
dopamine. know number people prescription drugs, Adderall,
Ritalin, modafinil, drugs course hit many transmitter systems, dopamine
certainly involved. People taking antidepressants like Wellbutrin tap system.
course people trying inhibit prolactin promote serotonin reduce
serotonin. me, seems like delicate dance, right? mean, just imagine
arousal arc mating behavior, sexual reproduction, elaborate
dance sympathetic drive parasympathetic drive, even across span
minutes, right? mean, talked podcast arousal
kind parasympathetic, orgasm sympathetic response, completely
different set neurons. see people getting trouble just trying
hit gas pedal dopamine think place people
perhaps experiencing low drive motivation, not just sexual, general,
increase amount dopamine circulating brain body? think
that, given wave pool analogy? - Yeah, important parse
start least powerful interventions. someone's concerned dopamine
maybe slightly higher prolactin, eliminate things
increasing prolactin. - as? - Casein gluten, mu opioid receptor
agonists mu opioid receptor agonist gut. - Casein, milk protein? -
Correct. - Can increase prolactin? - Correct. - Interesting. - addition that,
should, need pituitary MRI, get pituitary MRI. don't
adenoma don't high enough prolactin level need
MRI, visual symptoms, olfactory symptoms
nose, likely do. don't, lot times prolactin
40 not big deal. can take dopamine agonist agonize
D2 receptor like P5P, essentially vitamin B6. pyridoxine-5-
pyrophosphate. pyridoxine vitamin B6. can help, 50 milligrams
twice day. Vitamin E can also help, especially mixed tocopherols. lot
people high levels vitamin E, low levels gamma form vitamin E.
can also help. - Fascinating, glad mentioned vitamin B6 P5P.


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really

02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

science. [energetic music]


heard one can shorten refractory period orgasm, essentially able
sex again, quite direct it, way vitamin B6 blunting prolactin
response, turns quite potent. also heard vitamin B6 can
neurotoxic, especially periphery, can cause peripheral neuropathies
taken high doses. P5P safer form. true? - pre-activated,
not build up. Think allegory folate can build up. not methyl
folate, builds can increase levels homocystine. much
vitamin B12, another water soluble B vitamin, can much methylmalonic
acid MMA. depending enzymatic conversion active form
enzyme, often just safer take active form enzyme. - Yeah.
interesting. - Yeah. - Okay, well, risk going every hormonal pathway
talking supplementation, lifestyle factors,

02:12:30 L-Carnitine & Fertility, TMAO & Allicin (Garlic)

think touching on, have, testosterone estrogen, now prolactin, love
chat little bit L-carnitine. talked earlier, want raise
discussion L-carnitine, not context L-carnitine itself, context
fertility. read literature L-carnitine can beneficial
enhancing sperm quality egg quality even rates conception. forms
L-carnitine come people can reasonably consider? Again, talk doctor,
folks. doing? know it? often use
patients? - Yeah, way think L-carnitine, try tie
creatine, things well, cell energy factory car, L-
carnitine shuttle helps get fuel motor use motor. motor
mostly due lifestyle factors. like diet exercise. type fuel
NAD+. don't need get NAD precursors NMN NR, anything.
accessory fuel tank creatine phosphate. creatine accessory
fuel tank. NAD status, largely determined REM sleep quality
sleep exercise along supplementation fuel, carnitine shuttle
carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A. takes medium-chain fatty acids, takes
different molecules fat. two main energy sources ketones.
glucose carbs. fat fatty acids. takes across
layer mitochondria can utilized. upregulates that, things


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

will open question answer format ask questions,


will best answer real time. Thank joining
today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


flagella general, flagella going work better, like sperm. -
flagella anything, sort wavy little tenders cell types
everywhere, right? gut too, right, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - going
work significantly better. general, mitochondria going work better.
worst mitochondria off bat, better going helped
shuttle shuttles across. also slightly increases density
androgen receptor well. - local effect? L-carnitine injected
particular muscle, will increase density androgen receptors muscle? -
Likely so. - people taking L-carnitine? capsule forms
injectable forms. people going taking capsule forms,
going access to. also ask, can get L-carnitine
food? - Yeah, L-carnitine just combination of, actually small
peptide. glutathione just three amino acids. L-carnitine smallest peptide,
two. peptide just protein amino acids two 200.
L-carnitine just two amino acids. - Amazing, like micro-peptide? - Yeah,
body synthesizes enough. likes absorb amino acids themselves.
puts together, makes L-carnitine. not bioavailable
take it. lot people take L-carnitine, L-tartrate, acetyl-L-carnitine,
10% bioavailable. want 1 gram 1,000 milligrams L-carnitine, can take
10 grams oral L-carnitine. - one gram typical dose, recommend one
gram per day? - fertility androgen receptor upregulation. - means taking
10 grams capsule form? - Yeah. 15 20 capsules, lot. -
[Andrew] lot. - can also potentially increase TMAO. - Yeah, want ask
that, TMAO blood chart is, elevated, going
cause concern. taught trick, however, one can take 600 milligrams
garlic capsule allicin. called? - Allicin it, yeah. - like
name Allison two L's? - Yeah. - Okay. remarkable effect
reducing TMAO. quite potent also just coincidence really
brought LDL well? - not sure LDL coincidence, depending
gut microbiome microbiota, microbiome beneficial bacteria will
convert carnitine also choline. choline precursor like Alpha-GPC
phosphatidylserine, it'll will convert less TMAO. TMAO something
can get measured blood test see high low. people might
not even need allicin. - Interesting. - people benefit it. - Interesting,


although think also told allicin garlic can positive effects
cardiovascular tone blood flow generally. right? - Yeah. - Okay. 600
milligrams garlic excessive amount can just eat garlic? - can just eat- -
mean, like eating garlic. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, okay, one also just eat garlic.
one going take L-carnitine injectable form, much bioavailable? -
100% inject it. aqueous solution, bacteria static water essentially.
not carrier oil. going burn lot inject subcutaneously.
going absorbed faster evenly also just hurt lot less inject
muscle. - one just take one gram per day injected divide
couple doses? - Yeah, 500, minimally efficacious dose injectable's
probably around 200 comes sperm motility,

02:18:19 Blood Test Frequency

androgen receptor upregulation. really depends taking it. -
terms fertility, terms blood tests generally, always say possible, either
way insurance way way, affording it, great
people blood tests know hormone levels levels
things like metabolic markers lipids 20s, also 30s, also
40s. think idea take blood test problem,
course one can't actually comparison mentioned earlier
state comparison one's physician things changing time. seems
basically everyone get least once-a-year blood test.
hope insurance will someday just cover everybody? will standard care?
think everybody know sorts things floating around
bloodstream need less life. - doubt will ever
covered insurance. many cases, make argument indicated.
insurance begins cover population pathologies, things like
FSAs HSAs care credit will likely cover advanced testing, continues
come price.

02:19:41 Long-Term Relationships & Effects Hormones

it'll affordable, won't free. - Got it. Yeah. like shift gears slightly


talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly
provide links. guess question is, taking patients? sure
hear various venues people can contact you. active
terms public facing work? - active Instagram, kylegillettmd. also active
social medias brand new clinic, Gillett Health. @GillettHealth

case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

talk social interactions relational effects hormones. Something just
find fascinating. touched little bit earlier terms oral contraception,
now backdrop various hormones do, involvement
neurotransmitter systems like dopamine pro prolactin associated pathways.
Prolactin course hormone. Not neurotransmitter. phenomenon
human beings people get excited new partner excitement
no doubt related dopamine system among systems. excitement
can maintained can wane time. talking attraction,
also talking just general excitement sense novelty,
dopamine's associated with. Given work human beings lives
relationships lifestyles, hormones, things interact,
ways think adjusting relationships order
optimize hormones opposed just thinking optimize hormones
sake relationship? bidirectional course. assumes,
say, one already paying attention six pillars talked earlier, people
things right. think relationships hormones:
friendships, romantic relationships, new partners, longterm partners, yeah,
think kind stuff? - Yeah, new partner, largely
regulated dopaminergic system, changes time. people may
heard saying go full calendar year someone
relationship you- - good advice, way. - really
know not do. experience families
holidays different situations. argue moved
together, baby, raised baby, preferably breastfeeding,
get prolactin spikes, haven't really gone every stage
life yet. Now can't really every person considering. - Well,
people do, can quite costly terms time finances emotionally
costly. - Yeah. - here, definitely not referring personal experience
done many times over, suggest people think
enter relationship people longterm relationships
feel like something shifted, indeed shifts may reflect output
different hormone systems neurotransmitter systems. almost certainly
case, right? - Yeah, just like women spend lot time together, whether
coworkers whatever, lot times menstrual cycles will align.


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.

diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly

today's discussion Dr. Kyle Gillett. always, thank interest
science. [energetic music]


lot pheromonal hormonal crosstalk, including prolactin men women.
spending 100% time together, people think hard work
together live together. around 24/7. don't reprieve
let dopamine settle down, excited see
again. lot guys know gone hunting trip gone trip
long time, come back see partner, like new, not quite
like new relationship, almost like new relationship. excitement
again. purposely building every relationship can help significantly,
especially choose child get pregnant breastfeeding,
just plan ahead prolactins high dopamines
low. testosterones low. lot planning
can do. Essentially every relationship goes crisis. crisis personal
two you. can plan ahead figure way, maybe not
supplementation. Maybe not even amount time spend away
other. plan ahead good times know go crisis. -
Got it, sounds like time apart time together, actually built
number cultures men women will purposefully avoid
period time, avoid physical touch maybe proximity, will reconvene,
yet stable relationships time often. inverse also true?
instance, people long distance relationships, seeing
three four days week two days week, explain fact
relationships can go long period time without ever actually
entering the, call hyper-prolactin phase actually moving together et
cetera, et cetera. Like words, way people spiking
troughing dopamine keeps attached? kind elusive, sort of,
called? think called like cat string. Like play cat move
string away, keep reaching, throw string ground, like,
totally uninterested it. going on? 'Cause dopaminergic
phenomenon, cat string example. know experimentally. - cases,
relationship hasn't really progressed, many cases, past dopamine spike,
fun initial stage, honeymoon stage, whatever want call it. almost kind
like roommate. looking roommate, college college
whatever, can fill forms look common interests, actually
together



02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective

still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,

02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically
endocrinology textbook, neuroendocrinology textbook's worth information, ton
practical tips there. can people find you? will certainly

02:25:33 Nesting Instincts: Prolactin, Childbirth & Relationships

significant proportion time, not really going know going
compatible not. - evidence appearance infant changes,
obviously there're going hormonal shifts. know actually women
men, prolactin increase couples expecting child. almost
like brooding phenomenon. see birds actually called brooding
caused prolactin increase, turns also occurs humans.
people argue causes dad bod phenomenon, 'cause actually,
prolactin involved laying body fat, preparing sleepless nights.
presumably spike prolactin also suppress sexual activity,
periods time immediately near childbirth sexual activity not
advantageous. - Yeah, see prolactin spike right breastfeeding. think
it, often infant, breastfeed, put infant bed,
immediately go bed partner, not particularly conducive. almost
like trying intercourse back back. difficult. -
prolactin sense? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Low dopamine, high prolactin. Oxytocin also
increased significantly help milk let-down well. yeah, far brooding,
definitely human equivalent brooding. humans call nesting instinct,
helpful, not necessarily bad change relationship. just
change. long know coming, going better it. Just
like medication. aware side effect might happen,
happens, not less severe, also happens less often. - interesting. -
tell patient. - Well neuroscientist, come framework
course hormones impact perception behavior, perception behavior also
impact hormones. find fascinating. also really like example gave people
taking time apart, also affiliative bonds non-romantic bonds can serve
kind reservoir replenish dopamine released upon experience going
back one's partner sort regular feature home. interesting,
course exist sides. guessing male side
female side, interest kind separation reunion theme.
guess frequency will vary different couples different situations. - Yeah,
don't want make seem like prolactin bad, prolactin help


nesting instinct. helps breastfeeding well. lot women diagnosed
luteal phase defects, basically phase ovulation, period
giving birth. pregnancy's kind prolonged luteal phase. lot will go
progesterone this. Progesterone can also decrease prolactin prolactin also
helpful maturity lungs infants. helps sphingomyelin lecithin ratio.
prolactin's low pregnancy, spikes high pregnancy,
can lead increased risk respiratory distress newborn. - Really
interesting. Yeah. certainly don't want paint picture

02:29:05 Cold & Hot Exposure, Hormones & Fertility

prolactin bad hormone avoid. Without proactive, none us
course. vital. realized earlier raised question whether
not cold exposure modify hormone output, particular whether not ice baths
ice applied specific tissues body, people doing, one way other,
can change testosterone levels, estrogen levels. words, taking ice baths
cold showers increase testosterone and/or estrogen? - Yeah, taking ice bath
cold shower cold exposure general, not going correct vitamin D deficiency
metabolic syndrome. lot things will not correct causes
hypogonadism low testosterone, will help acutely, specifically application
cold testes warm. varicocele little bit
primary hypogonadism, testosterone not released testes,
LH FSH signals sufficiently high, likely respond cold exposure
better. actually undergarments designed specifically help
fertility. probably going future. just
need careful not get frost bite, particularly bad spot get frost
bite. - Noted. define varicocele? mentioned times.
varicose vein? - Yeah, essentially varicose vein. brings warm blood
venous flow flow back heart not good. Just like legs, can
happen scrotum. Usually 20 25% people one grade varicocele.
grades one four, one five. people just
mild one, usually left side blood go get back
heart. raises temperature testes. Temperature enemy
testes. like 5 10 degrees cooler rest body. -


saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really

compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.



02:54:18 Caffeine & Hormones

think will stimulate lot thinking, ultimately goal podcast.
Well, one final question listener insisted ask, straightforward
one. not curve ball not related just talking about.
common question told people going talking
you, is, caffeine problematic hormones? amazing, received hundreds
question caffeine. since probably commonly used drug
planet, know taking us back practical, closing, not
quite yet, closing caffeine effect, one way other,
testosterone, estrogen, hormones positive, negative neutral? -
affects sleep. works adenosine can actually slightly improve allergies
well, negligible effects otherwise. - Great. - Yep. - Well, sorry end
practical brass tacks type question, promise listeners ask
question. Listen, want sincerely thank you. covered basically

saunas particularly bad sperm production? - can be, yeah. - say can
be, mean, long one safely sauna, want go back
forth cold sauna? data? - someone
infertility, tell avoid saunas empirically. someone has, not
infertile, low sperm count, also tell avoid. However, mostly
warmed water can raise temperature testes faster sauna. -
hot tubs things sort? - Yeah, hot tub jacuzzi. enemies
number one number two sperm. - ice baths cold showers
women? evidence can shift hormone output women? - Yeah, can.
increases activity beta adrenergic receptors, even central nervous
system astrocytes well. can things. can slightly decrease
drive food, astrocytes beta adrenergic receptors have, medications
weight loss medicines also similar things. can beneficial women
too. - no evidence changes estrogen output

02:32:34 Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Tesamorelin, Ghrelin

women, correct? - Not know of. - No. either. Peptides, lot discussion
days peptides. Peptides course just strings amino acids,
mentioned small ones like two amino acids like L-carnitine way
polypeptides, just mean many amino acids. many peptides
probably just entire episode peptides, think one reasons
hearing much peptides days not called steroids.
name steroids think come associated anabolic steroids context
acne, testosterone rage, et cetera. course testoster, excuse me, estrogen
steroid hormone, right? steroid hormones, know.
peptides gaining increasing popularity. willing go record saying
can sure many incredible transformations see Hollywood
consequence peptide use. put name behind well
aware people use prepare roles, athletes use them.
everyday people using too. instance sermorelin, tesamorelin, ipamorelin,
stimulate release growth hormone rather taking growth hormone. BPC-157,
essentially synthetic gastric juice normally repairs gut, used
treat injuries. ones well. can say generally


peptides? safe? not safe? sourcing?
peptides think particular use people? probably
also touch peptides people shouldn't go anywhere near 10-foot pole. -
Yeah, definitely, peptides heterogeneous. dangerous ones
safe ones. favorite peptide original peptide, insulin. insulin
peptide less 100 years ago, scientist studying insulin.
point, saw animal diabetes cured insulin inject, cured, insulin
injection. Less year later, injecting insulin every type one diabetic,
saving lives. - yet insulin can kill take
incorrect dose? - Yeah, just like insulin prescribed doctor,
over-the-counter insulin, ReliOn NPH, ideally insulin prescribed
doctor diabetes, lifesaving. Peptides prescribed doctors
well. several FDA approved. mentioned lot different
ones. start tesamorelin. tesamorelin recently FDA approved
something called lipodystrophy. happens body fat displaced abnormal
areas, often part aids severe burns, things like that. helps redistribute
body fat give people quality life back. Tesamorelin GHRH, kind
loop category GHRPs, growth hormone-releasing peptides.
couple amino acids different endogenously-produced growth hormone-releasing
hormone. growth hormone also peptide. peptide hormone. Not
steroid hormone. different somatotrophs similar growth
hormone. Another fun fact HPL, human placental lactogen, love
acronyms, right? Human placental lactogen nearly identical growth hormone.
growth hormone pregnancy not causes sugar spike gestational
diabetes. human placental lactogen. look twin pregnancies,
two placentas placental tissue making human placental lactogen,
risk gestational diabetes exponentially higher. HPL couple
molecules different growth hormone. interesting different GHRHs
GHRPs actually pretty different mechanisms action. Ghrelin also
hormone released hungry. probably one reasons
growth hormone release overnight. lot peptides
similar ghrelin, peptides not bioidentical peptides, just
couple different amino acids changed. almost identical probably
going used future growth hormone deficiencies,



02:37:24 Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptides (GHRPs)

including kids, studied. - somebody wants increase growth
hormone output, addition not eating within two hours sleep, getting good, deep
sleep, things six pillars mentioned earlier, especially
resistance exercise point earlier day, risks benefits
taking growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide like sermorelin prescribed
doctor, course. one concerned about? long one take
these? even heard can modify gene expression really
changing hypothalamus long lasting ways. - Yeah, definitely lot
risk, tumor growth cancer. look type one diabetic, high
incidences various types cancer. high growth hormone, low
IGF-1 paradoxically. likely give similar cancer risk type one
diabetic high growth hormone. However, benefits it, think
lipolysis, decreased body fat, increased lean body mass. lot those, can use
things get benefits. don't need growth hormone
benefits. just leaves cosmetic benefit can usually use topicals get.
hair skin nails, lot things can
growth hormone. lot people just don't need GHRPs don't
lipodystrophy don't growth hormone deficiency. uses
them, specifically injuries. know studied, not sure
military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

military. mentioned woodpecker contrecoup injury. obviously. -
head jolting back forth brain basically slamming front
skull. - So- - Football, heading ball soccer, definitely people use 50
caliber military, although fairly small population. think anyone hit
head hard

02:39:38 BPC-157 & Injury, Dosing Frequency

once. - Yeah, can talk BPC-157 bit, GHK-copper peptide
bit. TB-500 thymosin beta-4 analog. can also talk bremelanotide,
melanotan III. melanotan II, also melanotan
III IV. - Yeah, talk BPC-157 melanotan, 'cause think


ones people eyeing, speak. - Yeah, BPC-157 body protective
compound 157. identical bio-identical gastric protective compound 157
produced stomach. age, get atrophic gastritis often.
less intrinsic factor, kind another peptide binds vitamin B12.
can get age-related B12 deficiencies. one reason
colitis, diverticulitis age. don't gastric protective
compound. increases VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, basically makes
blood vessels grow more. causes body form blood vessel.
another medication known Avastin. list essential medications
cancer. many different types cancer, including colon cancer, treat
Avastin, VEGF inhibitor. cancer high cancer risk,
probably don't want taking medication exact opposite mechanism
action essential anti-cancer med. - words, cancer,
risk cancer, avoid BPC-157? - Correct, lot people prescribe six weeks
BPC-157, bremelanotide, FDA approved hypoactive sexual disorder.
Tesamorelin, also approved lipodystrophy. Interestingly another one
melanotans also approved lipodystrophy. also deficiency melanocortin
receptor. receptor receives alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
rare condition. also approved that, don't take it, get
obesity. BPC-157 not FDA approved, essentially standard care
point. say it's, not counting insulin growth hormone peptides,
one commonly used peptides anecdotally, clinical literature,
fairly well tolerated short periods time. not camp everybody
needs two three times week even daily six weeks no matter what.
major benefit going take early on, going allow
body increase blood flow injured area, less blood flow has,
example, cartilage, ligaments horrible blood flow, especially people age,
going make significant difference. wager Russian gymnast
achilles healed one month completely full rupture likely taking BPC-
157 something similar. - Yeah, willing wager well, remarkable
recovery. prescription, non-prescription forms,
understanding non-prescription forms danger going non-
prescription forms oftentimes will contain claim contain, BPC-
157 case, not adequately cleaning LPS,


lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,

02:48:21 Spiritual Health Impact Mental & Physical Health



know lot there. lot interest. want talk
sixth pillar, right? just remind people, said diet, exercise, appropriate,
caloric restriction, managing stress, sleep sunlight critical everyone
ages manage optimize hormone health. sixth category,
really intriguing one, spirit. kind unusual thing hear coming
medical doctor, except many colleagues indeed former
director National Institutes Health, Francis Collins talked notion
spirit. talked belief effects podcast Alia Crum,
one's understanding things world general really creates
important effect everything level physiology, not just psychology.
physician, conceptualize spiritual aspect? talk
patients this, given people walking clinic presumably bunch
different religious not religious backgrounds. sure atheists.
probably strong believers. deal that? people think
this? - Yeah, believe surprisingly well received. wouldn't think first
glance patient really wants talk spiritual health doctor,
way think way really like Venn diagram
body mind soul. can't one healthy without
healthy, even mental health phenomenal, even physical health
phenomenal, mental aspect spirituality, piece not there, going
affect body physiologically well. Alia Crum's done excellent work.
also lot studies regarding prayer. Christian, believe
God. gives lot resilience motivation. gives
cornerstone groundwork, can interact life. regardless someone's
atheist regardless someone believes far religion origin
species, can know spirituality going profound effect
mental physical health well. People like compartmentalize it. like
talk doctor physical health 'cause comfortable that.
talk pastor mom reiki healer spiritual health. just
talk therapist psychiatrist mental health. need bring
three things together. well known interdisciplinary clinics lead
improved patient outcomes just disciplines within medicine. just
doctors specializing this. takes step back upper part
tree reached dichotomies split-offs. body


mind soul, spiritual health mental health
physical health. line three things, builds cornerstone
rest health rest life. - someone comes clinic
say, feeling one way body, feeling one way
emotional life, run charts, get blood work, atheist
agnostic, sixth pillar practices can consider
keeping atheism agnosticism? assume people
participate feel belong particular religious sex will
particular prescriptives religious sex will direct towards particular
types prayer. somebody doesn't prescriptive coming
source, do? - Yeah,
certainly don't force prayer anybody anything like that. belief being,
especially agnostic, almost hardest thing, atheist,
groundwork spirituality, even
human spirits' interaction environment, things can't physically
explained well, phenomenon like work Alia Crum does. agnostic,
still trying find that. hope everybody find truly believe
far spirituality. yeah, personal journey. physician's
standpoint, even friends well friend's standpoint, don't
like push anybody specific direction. don't think everybody
believe believe. don't feel like pressure
believe something different. think can excellent physician-patient
rapport, regardless believe backgrounds are. - Yeah.
wonderful hear. can say without revealing names close colleagues
that, every bin spectrum, like hardcore atheists, hardcore religious different
domains, different religions, don't know, don't know know many agnostic,
whether not know agnostics, say. not something people
commonly discuss, context science medicine, starting happen
more. certainly issue spirituality one areas
neuroscience asking lot questions. Like spiritual experiences really
terms grounded brain not grounded brain. think
really interesting area discovery. appreciate bring up, bring
non-pressured way do.

lipopolysaccharide can cause inflammation. fact, laboratory, use LPS
deliberately induce fever inflammation study systemic inflammation.
warning people. interested peptides, absolutely need work
physician, opinion. - Yeah. - Get really good compounding pharmacy
cleans LPS. buying source lot people,
don't want name sources, common sources internet
everyone knows about. buying sources, ship anyone
essentially. LPS really causing inflammation many people experience
kind mild fever tingling inject like, oh, can feel
working. probably LPS action, not good brain. don't know
peripheral tissues. haven't heard people dropping dead stuff yet,
certainly wouldn't want ingesting LPs unnecessarily. agree
work doctor? doctor. - Yeah. Definitely talk
doctor talk dosing regimen well.
six weeks, ask 'em six weeks? not two weeks
not soon feel better? Can just stop it? Yeah, lot good
questions like ask doctor. somebody's trying prescribe
bunch different things, see, prescribe everybody
individualized me? peptides like GHK-copper peptide produced
endogenously liver younger ages. liver can regenerate
fully, this, GHK-copper peptide helps. copper deficient, not
whole lot people are, lot people bariatric surgery copper
deficient, GHK-copper peptide can help significantly nervous system.
also synergistic. growth agonist like thymosin beta-4 made kids thymus,
shrinks. another reason kids heal really well. GHK
somewhat synergistic BPC, don't need three, don't want them.
don't need week, don't want week. -
really appreciate saying that. often say sometimes best dose something
take zero.

02:45:23 Uses Melanotan

often case best dosage zero. mentioned melanotan.
several kinds melanotan. find little bit funny conversation, first


learned melanotan reading peptides discovering people
injecting melanotan get tan, melanin synthesis pathway. also
discovered, isn't individual. reading various manuscripts
peer-reviewed papers cause things like priapism, like sustained erection,
might last one anyone ever damage
vasculature. Also women taking melanotan way get tan lose body fat.
sounds recreational. clinical usage melanotan? separate
kind extreme biohacking cosmetic world, really not main focus
podcast ever, terms health, pursuing health optimization. - Yeah,
actually three FDA approved indications, believe not. Not many people know
this, three well accepted indications. One hypoactive sexual
disorder, women, bremelanotide. - So- - women
essentially no libido whatsoever? - Yeah. - hormones check?
Yeah, classically menopause. hormonal issues not contributing.
give peptide, also known PT-141, helps significantly.
lot times use nasal spray. goes straight central nervous system
acts centrally. can also inject it, can also take via troche. - Men
women take it? - Correct. approved women. can also help men.
relatively safe. relative contraindication tell people lot people say,
oh, no side effects know of. family history melanoma
potentially melanoma don't know it, big advocate
dermoscopy well regular skin checks, theoretically going increase
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, can grow that. definitely not
good thing. careful longterm administration it. also approved
lipodystrophy, exact thing tesamorelin, believe also
known Evista Egrifta. also approved rare genetic condition
receptors melanocytes don't proliferate well, usually
hypopigmentation. not true albinism, associated morbid obesity
poor outcomes childhood, used kids actually. - Interesting, well,
peptides fascinating landscape, thank deep dive several
them. will probably return talk peptides near future,
