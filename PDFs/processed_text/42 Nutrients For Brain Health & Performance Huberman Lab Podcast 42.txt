frequent questions get food brain. Everybody
seems want know eat shouldn't eat order
peak brain function, able focus, memorize things, forth, order
maintain brain health time, nobody wants lose memory
troubles cognition. Fortunately, lot data now really good quality
peer-reviewed studies indicate certain things can do, including certain foods
eat, perhaps, even foods avoid, order
enhance brain function. And, course, say, brain, really mean

cetera, doesn't just depend neurons, nerve cells head, also
depends spinal cord, neurons connect organs body.
general, two categories things going improve brain health
perspective nutrition. first category general category things

aware vitally important, now, like
turn elements shown vitally important directly controlling,
mediating neuron function. Neurons, course, nerve cells brain,
cell types, too, course, will impact brain function. prominent
so-called glia. Glia means glue. even though, long time, people
thought cells just kind holding things together passively, glia play
active role metabolism neurons brain function, probably, also,
cognition, thinking, forth. things directly impact brain
health, foods can eat will support brain health? Generally,


think neuron function brain function, default discussion

require lot it. cases, use ketones, will talk little bit
later, especially people following low carbohydrate ketogenic diet.
can even consider fuels neurons use order function,
talk elements actually allow neurons stay healthy,
actually makes neurons. brings us to, argue,
important food element brain function, fat. may come
surprise, unless one considers water content brain, high,
lot brain, lot integrity nerve cells, so-called neurons

time. mentioned earlier, fat makes neurons nerve
cells different types fat body. type fat it,
eat order support fat neurons? answer so-
called essential fatty acids phospholipids. Now, are, less,
thing, just want make large literature crystal clear. Essential fatty
acids can include so-called EPA variety DHA variety. hear omega-3s
omega-6s. people getting enough omega-6s diet. Not
everybody, people getting enough omega-6s. However, people
not getting enough omega-3s diet support healthy brain function short
long-term. talked benefits elevating levels omega-3s

wealth literature now pointing fact ingesting least one, two,
even three grams per day EPA form essential fatty acid can effects, positive
effects, mood wellbeing least par major
antidepressant treatments there, without similar side effects
antidepressant treatments. people already taking antidepressants,
supplementing one, two, three grams EPA essential fatty acids can
actually allow lower dose antidepressant treatment used, still effective.
depression. just terms maintaining normal cognitive function people
aren't depressed, EPAs omega-3s seem play important role.
course, can supplement EPAs various fish oils, liquid fish oil,
capsule fish oil. people, not interested eating fish whatever
reason, allergic, ethical reasons, can take krill oil. don't
want use krill oil, can use algae forms EPA. However, think
clear, one can get lot EPA proper foods. turns out,
foods, not surprisingly, don't just contain high levels EPA, also contain
things beneficial brain health. foods high omega-3s
probably consuming, least daily basis? number one
fish. things like mackerel, salmon, herring, oysters, sardines,
anchovies. perhaps, heavyweight champion EPAs per unit volume caviar.
Now, don't know you, not eating lot fish. not eating lot caviar.
don't think... can't remember last time caviar, unless sprinkled
little bit sushi. not big fish eater personally. will time time. one
reason one might want supplement EPAs another source. also,
EPAs found chia seeds, walnuts, soybeans, plant-based foods.
can look online, immediately see lot sources
EPAs. many foods listed off might appetizing you,
might unappetizing you, might sort neutral about.
clear, eating foods rich omega-3s, and/or supplementing
omega-3s, get 1.5 grams, ideally, two, even three grams, per
day EPA can beneficial cognitive function short long-term. Later
episode, going talk actually change relationship particular
foods, foods don't particularly like, can actually start like more,
might important thinking, mackerel, sardines.
making face, 'cause, frankly, not foods naturally like. again,


want emphasize, don't consume fish animal products order
get sufficient EPAs. can get plants. believe, based quality
peer-reviewed research, everybody striving get minimum threshold
least gram half EPAs per day one way other. great thing
omega-3s also thought beneficial things like cardiovascular
health. although controversy whether not two grams,
three grams, six grams ideal cardiovascular health, think bulk evidence
points fact getting sufficient omega-3s diet going support

cardiovascular health. Aerobic exercise, forth, important also.
seem support cardio vascular health, so, supporting brain health.
However, emphasizing is, ingestion omega-3s support cells within

lipid-like compound that, least three studies, shown improve cognition.
weren't huge effects, statistically significant effects. well
three, least five studies, reduce cognitive decline. interesting.
every case, 300 milligrams supplemented phosphatidylserine, one, again,
doesn't need supplement phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine can derived,
mentioned, meats fish, extent, cabbage things.
don't know much cabbage people ingesting. later, talk gut

foods. And, course, one readily available fermented foods
least many people find appetizing sauerkraut, is, course, made
cabbage. fermented cabbage. consume meat fish,
provided getting enough fish, probably getting enough phosphatidylserine.
interested supplementing phosphatidylserine get


effects reported various manuscripts, which, way, read,
looked solid. mean, don't think seen landmark study showing

00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold)

going create huge offsetting massive cognitive decline, massive increase

always referred hunter gatherers, one hears hunters, often
think meat animal sources. indeed, species, hunted many, many
species animals consume them, still do. also fished. talked
earlier. consumed lot fish, consumed lot eggs. Eggs
incredibly rich source nutrients brain, egg, actually,
think it, contains nutrients required order organism
grow. know, bird egg shell, got yolk there, using yolk
reason. using yolk source fuel. using yolk source of,
literally, building blocks order create nervous system. Many years ago, worked
chick embryos, amazing experiments. actually take

choline. people will supplement choline. However, food sources seem
best source choline. EPAs omega-3s, plenty
foods non-animal-based contain choline. somebody
doesn't eat eggs, doesn't want eat eggs, things like potatoes, nuts, seeds,
grains, fruit, don't much choline eggs, contain choline.


can look values choline present various foods,
make sure reaching threshold amount choline you. general,
people probably strive get somewhere 500 milligrams gram
choline per day. 1,000 milligrams. people rely supplementation order
hit levels, not eating lot egg yolks, not eating
lot foods. Certain fish contain choline, instance, foods listed
off minutes ago plant-based sources. people will supplement
50 100 milligrams, whatever amount necessary get one gram,
even two gram, dose per day. three things know can support
nerve cells. EPA, particular, omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, choline,
three things list off top three things

00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4)

enhancing neuron function, integrity neurons short long-term.
this, again, setting aside vitally important factors hydration electrolytes.
said podcasts, not ingesting enough water,
not getting enough sodium, magnesium, potassium, then, obviously,
neurons can't run, lot brain water. need maintain proper
hydration. sodium, potassium, magnesium important order nerve cells
function. fact, actually components, ions, pass across
lipid membranes, little fatty membranes talking earlier,
allow neurons generate electrical activity communicate one another.
definitely, want hydrate enough. will entire episode
hydration electrolytes. omega-3s, EPAs, phosphatidylserine, choline,
obvious going improve brain function. much will improve brain function
probably depends well brain working previously. fact, many
studies looked effectiveness compounds looked people
suffering mild even severe cognitive decline. outcomes
studies vary, given interest maintaining brain function, given fact
don't make new neurons throughout entire life, given everybody eat,
quality healthy foods ingesting anyways.

00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week)



clear can support brain function degree another. Many
people will ask light information. can talk
works me, choose ingest fish oil mainly liquid form, turns
easiest way economically affordable way people.
various forms liquid fish oil there. include lemon
flavoring, doesn't taste like fish oil, frankly, fish oil, me, sort noxious
tasting. take tablespoon that, two, per day. traveling, use
capsule form order hit threshold. me, two, sometimes even three,
grams per day EPA. not just two three grams per day fish oil, two three
grams per day EPA. Now, eating fish, mentioned earlier, not often,
might reduce amount fish oil take. major source fish
oil. Currently, not supplement phosphatidylserine. number people
know trust, indeed, several colleagues mine, take phosphatidylserine.
don't good explanation don't take yet, not tried
supplementing yet. Maybe have, can place experience
comment section. interest. terms choline, order get
choline diet, pay attention various foods contain choline, try
get foods semi-regular basis. supplement something called
alpha-GPC, is, essentially, acetylcholine pathway, biosynthesis pathway.
don't take often, will take 300 milligrams alpha-GPC time time.
time time, mean anywhere two three times per week. generally
early day, 'cause it, me, can little bit stimulant effect. Although,
not nearly stimulating, say, double espresso, triple espresso. one
way enhance choline function. people choose get
supplementation, straightforward. lot supplements
contain alpha-GPC. people taking dosages high 900 milligrams per
day. sounds high me. studies offsetting cognitive decline using
alpha-GPC use quite high dosages 600 900, even 1200, milligrams per day.
used much higher concentrations. because, fortunately,
least, not yet, not awareness, not suffering cognitive decline,

00:32:22 Creatine Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day)



will supplement 300 milligrams every now again. Next list
compounds shown peer-reviewed research improve neuronal
brain function creatine. Creatine can derived meat sources. can also
supplemented. probably familiar creatine heard
creatine context health fitness world, creatine used bring
water muscles, can enhance strength muscles, well
bring water tissues. doesn't just draw water muscle, can draw
water body generally. Creatine also shown important
role brain function. again, something came
discussion depression episodes back. Creatine can actually used
fuel source brain. evidence can enhance function
certain frontal cortical circuits feed onto, rather, connect to, areas
brain involved mood regulation motivation. creatine
plays role depression, rather, creatine supplementation seems able
assist forms mild depression. emerging literature. still not
well-established. However, now ample evidence creatine supplementation
can enhance brain function certain contexts. interested learning
contexts are, excellent review just came out. first
author Roschel, R-O-S-C-H-E-L. will provide link study, rather,
review, excuse me, caption. published just recently 2021.
one thing make clear, creatine supplementation shown
especially useful people not consuming meat sources foods
rich creatine. threshold level creatine supplement order
get cognitive benefit? appears least five grams per day. Now,
typical form creatine so-called creatine monohydrate. forms
creatine well, thought not draw much water non-muscle
tissues, people, attractive them. don't want water sitting
skin, et cetera. emphasize, responses creatine
sense can differ. people get little bit water retention. people experience
more. evidence creatine can impact hormonal pathways,
might enhance levels so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT, therefore,
DHT involved hair loss, theories creatine can cause
hair loss. indeed, people DHT sensitive, might. going
lot variation person person terms much creatine impacts DHT,


many DHT receptors scalp, therefore, whether not
experience hair loss. just giving information, aware
various things creatine can do. nonetheless, think interesting creatine
supplementation five grams per day, creatine monohydrate, shown
improve cognition people aren't getting creatine animal sources.
evidence detailed within review just described, creatine
supplementation can also enhance cognition people also eating animal
products. personally take creatine five grams per day, long time.
can't say noticed tremendous benefit, actually never really
come off it, never done control experiment. take kind
baseline insurance policy. me, probably losing, certainly losing
hair. Whether not due creatine not, never done analysis.
can say that, generally consume things like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC set
general context support neurons, brain. And, course, also pay
attention foods contain various compounds. don't actively eat
additional meat

00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries)

just obtain creatine. eat fairly limited amount meat. don't restrict it, eat
meat, don't actively seek creatine diet. Rather, use supplementation
order hit five grams per day threshold. Next list foods beneficial

practice putting pictures blueberries dark berries next title
says, "Foods benefit brain". lot foods

berries, blackberries, dark currants, thin-skinned berries
purpleish color, contain called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins
actually really nice data support fact improve brain function.
Now, whether not direct effects neurons, whether not lowering
inflammation, modulatory effect, isn't quite clear. think now,
enough data support fact eating cup two blueberries pretty
often, every day, maybe blackberries, maybe black currants,
anthocyanins good us, enhancing overall wellbeing

three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat

aren't depressed, EPAs omega-3s seem play important role.
course, can supplement EPAs various fish oils, liquid fish oil,
capsule fish oil. people, not interested eating fish whatever
reason, allergic, ethical reasons, can take krill oil. don't
want use krill oil, can use algae forms EPA. However, think
clear, one can get lot EPA proper foods. turns out,
foods, not surprisingly, don't just contain high levels EPA, also contain
things beneficial brain health. foods high omega-3s

Now, don't know you, not eating lot fish. not eating lot caviar.
don't think... can't remember last time caviar, unless sprinkled

reason one might want supplement EPAs another source. also,
EPAs found chia seeds, walnuts, soybeans, plant-based foods.
can look online, immediately see lot sources
EPAs. many foods listed off might appetizing you,
might unappetizing you, might sort neutral about.
clear, eating foods rich omega-3s, and/or supplementing
omega-3s, get 1.5 grams, ideally, two, even three grams, per

making face, 'cause, frankly, not foods naturally like. again,


want emphasize, don't consume fish animal products order
get sufficient EPAs. can get plants. believe, based quality

However, emphasizing is, ingestion omega-3s support cells within

weren't huge effects, statistically significant effects. well
three, least five studies, reduce cognitive decline. interesting.
every case, 300 milligrams supplemented phosphatidylserine, one, again,
doesn't need supplement phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine can derived,
mentioned, meats fish, extent, cabbage things.
don't know much cabbage people ingesting. later, talk gut

provided getting enough fish, probably getting enough phosphatidylserine.
interested supplementing phosphatidylserine get

00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold)

going create huge offsetting massive cognitive decline, massive increase

always referred hunter gatherers, one hears hunters, often
think meat animal sources. indeed, species, hunted many, many
species animals consume them, still do. also fished. talked
earlier. consumed lot fish, consumed lot eggs. Eggs
incredibly rich source nutrients brain, egg, actually,
think it, contains nutrients required order organism

best source choline. EPAs omega-3s, plenty
foods non-animal-based contain choline. somebody
doesn't eat eggs, doesn't want eat eggs, things like potatoes, nuts, seeds,
grains, fruit, don't much choline eggs, contain choline.


can look values choline present various foods,
make sure reaching threshold amount choline you. general,
people probably strive get somewhere 500 milligrams gram
choline per day. 1,000 milligrams. people rely supplementation order
hit levels, not eating lot egg yolks, not eating
lot foods. Certain fish contain choline, instance, foods listed
off minutes ago plant-based sources. people will supplement
50 100 milligrams, whatever amount necessary get one gram,
even two gram, dose per day. three things know can support
nerve cells. EPA, particular, omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, choline,
three things list off top three things

00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4)

enhancing neuron function, integrity neurons short long-term.
this, again, setting aside vitally important factors hydration electrolytes.
said podcasts, not ingesting enough water,
not getting enough sodium, magnesium, potassium, then, obviously,
neurons can't run, lot brain water. need maintain proper
hydration. sodium, potassium, magnesium important order nerve cells
function. fact, actually components, ions, pass across
lipid membranes, little fatty membranes talking earlier,
allow neurons generate electrical activity communicate one another.
definitely, want hydrate enough. will entire episode
hydration electrolytes. omega-3s, EPAs, phosphatidylserine, choline,
obvious going improve brain function. much will improve brain function
probably depends well brain working previously. fact, many
studies looked effectiveness compounds looked people
suffering mild even severe cognitive decline. outcomes
studies vary, given interest maintaining brain function, given fact
don't make new neurons throughout entire life, given everybody eat,
quality healthy foods ingesting anyways.

00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week)



clear can support brain function degree another. Many
people will ask light information. can talk
works me, choose ingest fish oil mainly liquid form, turns
easiest way economically affordable way people.
various forms liquid fish oil there. include lemon
flavoring, doesn't taste like fish oil, frankly, fish oil, me, sort noxious
tasting. take tablespoon that, two, per day. traveling, use
capsule form order hit threshold. me, two, sometimes even three,
grams per day EPA. not just two three grams per day fish oil, two three
grams per day EPA. Now, eating fish, mentioned earlier, not often,
might reduce amount fish oil take. major source fish
oil. Currently, not supplement phosphatidylserine. number people
know trust, indeed, several colleagues mine, take phosphatidylserine.
don't good explanation don't take yet, not tried
supplementing yet. Maybe have, can place experience

choline diet, pay attention various foods contain choline, try
get foods semi-regular basis. supplement something called
alpha-GPC, is, essentially, acetylcholine pathway, biosynthesis pathway.
don't take often, will take 300 milligrams alpha-GPC time time.
time time, mean anywhere two three times per week. generally

not nearly stimulating, say, double espresso, triple espresso. one
way enhance choline function. people choose get
supplementation, straightforward. lot supplements
contain alpha-GPC. people taking dosages high 900 milligrams per

alpha-GPC use quite high dosages 600 900, even 1200, milligrams per day.
used much higher concentrations. because, fortunately,
least, not yet, not awareness, not suffering cognitive decline,

00:32:22 Creatine Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day)



will supplement 300 milligrams every now again. Next list
compounds shown peer-reviewed research improve neuronal
brain function creatine. Creatine can derived meat sources. can also
supplemented. probably familiar creatine heard
creatine context health fitness world, creatine used bring
water muscles, can enhance strength muscles, well
bring water tissues. doesn't just draw water muscle, can draw
water body generally. Creatine also shown important
role brain function. again, something came
discussion depression episodes back. Creatine can actually used
fuel source brain. evidence can enhance function
certain frontal cortical circuits feed onto, rather, connect to, areas
brain involved mood regulation motivation. creatine
plays role depression, rather, creatine supplementation seems able
assist forms mild depression. emerging literature. still not
well-established. However, now ample evidence creatine supplementation
can enhance brain function certain contexts. interested learning
contexts are, excellent review just came out. first
author Roschel, R-O-S-C-H-E-L. will provide link study, rather,
review, excuse me, caption. published just recently 2021.
one thing make clear, creatine supplementation shown
especially useful people not consuming meat sources foods
rich creatine. threshold level creatine supplement order
get cognitive benefit? appears least five grams per day. Now,
typical form creatine so-called creatine monohydrate. forms
creatine well, thought not draw much water non-muscle
tissues, people, attractive them. don't want water sitting
skin, et cetera. emphasize, responses creatine
sense can differ. people get little bit water retention. people experience
more. evidence creatine can impact hormonal pathways,
might enhance levels so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT, therefore,
DHT involved hair loss, theories creatine can cause
hair loss. indeed, people DHT sensitive, might. going
lot variation person person terms much creatine impacts DHT,


many DHT receptors scalp, therefore, whether not
experience hair loss. just giving information, aware
various things creatine can do. nonetheless, think interesting creatine
supplementation five grams per day, creatine monohydrate, shown
improve cognition people aren't getting creatine animal sources.
evidence detailed within review just described, creatine
supplementation can also enhance cognition people also eating animal
products. personally take creatine five grams per day, long time.
can't say noticed tremendous benefit, actually never really
come off it, never done control experiment. take kind
baseline insurance policy. me, probably losing, certainly losing
hair. Whether not due creatine not, never done analysis.
can say that, generally consume things like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC set
general context support neurons, brain. And, course, also pay
attention foods contain various compounds. don't actively eat
additional meat

00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries)

just obtain creatine. eat fairly limited amount meat. don't restrict it, eat
meat, don't actively seek creatine diet. Rather, use supplementation
order hit five grams per day threshold. Next list foods beneficial
brain health one probably seen pictures online, seems
practice putting pictures blueberries dark berries next title
says, "Foods benefit brain". lot foods

berries, blackberries, dark currants, thin-skinned berries
purpleish color, contain called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins
actually really nice data support fact improve brain function.
Now, whether not direct effects neurons, whether not lowering
inflammation, modulatory effect, isn't quite clear. think now,
enough data support fact eating cup two blueberries pretty
often, every day, maybe blackberries, maybe black currants,
anthocyanins good us, enhancing overall wellbeing

now, talked foods micronutrients beneficial

true, actual mechanisms underlie food seeking food preference far
interesting that. basically three channels body nervous

three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue

lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,
et cetera, salty, salty, sour, think lemon lemon juice, instance.
mentioned umami. umami receptor receptor responds savory taste

bitter, sweet tastes nothing, plain water. go in,
able selectively silence neurons represent sweet. that,
eliminate preference sweet taste. Now, might seem obvious, neurons
respond sweet, silence neurons, no longer seek sweet.
strike you, also, incredible, not actually changing

therefore, no increase brain metabolism, dopamine levels eventually start rise.
dopamine levels eventually start rise, essentially conditioned
reinforced artificial non-caloric sweetener, subjects start consume

that, consuming artificial sweeteners, consuming longer

this, tend to, say, people report, ingest
artificial sweeteners, first, don't taste good, then, time, seem

another condition explored, really interesting condition,

50 100 milligrams, whatever amount necessary get one gram,
even two gram, dose per day. three things know can support
nerve cells. EPA, particular, omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, choline,
three things list off top three things

actually really nice data support fact improve brain function.
Now, whether not direct effects neurons, whether not lowering

enough data support fact eating cup two blueberries pretty
often, every day, maybe blackberries, maybe black currants,
anthocyanins good us, enhancing overall wellbeing

therefore, no increase brain metabolism, dopamine levels eventually start rise.
dopamine levels eventually start rise, essentially conditioned

this, tend to, say, people report, ingest
artificial sweeteners, first, don't taste good, then, time, seem

another condition explored, really interesting condition,

actually really nice data support fact improve brain function.
Now, whether not direct effects neurons, whether not lowering

enough data support fact eating cup two blueberries pretty
often, every day, maybe blackberries, maybe black currants,
anthocyanins good us, enhancing overall wellbeing

hope find list beneficial you. not use, least consideration.
now, talked foods micronutrients beneficial


immediate long-term brain health, like shift gears somewhat, talk
like foods like. heard hardwired
pursue sugar, like fatty foods, calorie-rich foods attractive us
sorts reasons, know, surviving famines, things sort.
true, actual mechanisms underlie food seeking food preference far
interesting that. basically three channels body nervous

will find particular food attractive, whether not will want consume
it, whether not want avoid it, whether not just sort so-so, refer
yum, yuck, meh analysis. indeed, nervous system
respect food. trying figure whether not, yum, want
this, yuck, want avoid this, meh, so-so. Now, may seem like overly
simplified version food seeking food preference, actually not far
truth. actually correctly captures much biology food preference. talk
three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue
elsewhere mouth detect various chemicals contained within food,
lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,
et cetera, salty, salty, sour, think lemon lemon juice, instance.
mentioned umami. umami receptor receptor responds savory taste
things. might find really wonderfully rich tomato sauce.
eat meat, like meat, really well cooked ,not necessarily well done,
properly cooked, say, steak, thing. umami present
plant animal foods, gives us sensation savoriness. almost kind
little bit briny taste it, braised taste it. indeed, brazing meats
brazing vegetables done specifically activate umami receptor.
five basic tastes. chemical sensors tongue that, call,
transduce chemicals. chemicals, literally, food bind receptors,
transduced, meaning binding chemicals receptors


converted electrical signal travels tongue along called
gustatory nerve. gustatory nerve synapses, meaning makes connections

called insular cortex, insula. want highlight insula episode,

important thing understand, neurons areas cortex,

really, really like that, really like savory foods, happen to.

tamp issue down, studies done Charles Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R...


absolutely phenomenal neuroscientist Columbia University New York. Studies done
Zuker Lab shown that, first all, identify neurons

non-overlapping populations neurons. using molecular tricks,
able either silence activate neurons that, instance, respond
sweet. this, see incredible consequences perception that, indeed,
occur brain, brain well, time without kind

identify neurons respond sweet tastes. see, many researchers
seen, subjects prefer sweet taste tastes, certainly, sweet tastes
bitter, sweet tastes nothing, plain water. go in,
able selectively silence neurons represent sweet. that,
eliminate preference sweet taste. Now, might seem obvious, neurons
respond sweet, silence neurons, no longer seek sweet.
strike you, also, incredible, not actually changing
happening tongue deeper layers brain. Conversely, can
subjects drink bitter water plain water activating, selectively activating,
neurons respond sweet. find, subjects will actively
prefer bitter plain water actual preferences, sweet. means
that, perception like central, meaning deep within brain,

normal conditions, aren't experimental manipulations done,
things positively correlated. Sweet tastes trigger activation sweet

therefore, no increase brain metabolism, dopamine levels eventually start rise.
dopamine levels eventually start rise, essentially conditioned

three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue

lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,
et cetera, salty, salty, sour, think lemon lemon juice, instance.
mentioned umami. umami receptor receptor responds savory taste

three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue

lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,

now, talked foods micronutrients beneficial

like foods like. heard hardwired
pursue sugar, like fatty foods, calorie-rich foods attractive us
sorts reasons, know, surviving famines, things sort.
true, actual mechanisms underlie food seeking food preference far

simplified version food seeking food preference, actually not far
truth. actually correctly captures much biology food preference. talk
three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue
elsewhere mouth detect various chemicals contained within food,
lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,
et cetera, salty, salty, sour, think lemon lemon juice, instance.
mentioned umami. umami receptor receptor responds savory taste
things. might find really wonderfully rich tomato sauce.
eat meat, like meat, really well cooked ,not necessarily well done,

respond sweet, silence neurons, no longer seek sweet.

hope find list beneficial you. not use, least consideration.
now, talked foods micronutrients beneficial


immediate long-term brain health, like shift gears somewhat, talk
like foods like. heard hardwired
pursue sugar, like fatty foods, calorie-rich foods attractive us
sorts reasons, know, surviving famines, things sort.
true, actual mechanisms underlie food seeking food preference far
interesting that. basically three channels body nervous
system decide foods pursue, much eat, whether not
will find particular food attractive, whether not will want consume
it, whether not want avoid it, whether not just sort so-so, refer
yum, yuck, meh analysis. indeed, nervous system
respect food. trying figure whether not, yum, want
this, yuck, want avoid this, meh, so-so. Now, may seem like overly
simplified version food seeking food preference, actually not far
truth. actually correctly captures much biology food preference. talk
three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue
elsewhere mouth detect various chemicals contained within food,
lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,
et cetera, salty, salty, sour, think lemon lemon juice, instance.
mentioned umami. umami receptor receptor responds savory taste
things. might find really wonderfully rich tomato sauce.
eat meat, like meat, really well cooked ,not necessarily well done,
properly cooked, say, steak, thing. umami present
plant animal foods, gives us sensation savoriness. almost kind
little bit briny taste it, braised taste it. indeed, brazing meats
brazing vegetables done specifically activate umami receptor.
five basic tastes. chemical sensors tongue that, call,
transduce chemicals. chemicals, literally, food bind receptors,
transduced, meaning binding chemicals receptors


converted electrical signal travels tongue along called
gustatory nerve. gustatory nerve synapses, meaning makes connections
brainstem so-called nucleus solitary tract. nuclei back
there. Nuclei just aggregates neurons. sends information so-
called insular cortex, insula. want highlight insula episode,
going return insula episode, later. insular
cortex incredible structure mainly concerned so-called
interoception, perception going inside body.
amount pressure gut much food eaten.
acidity gut, little bit indigestion, instance. can also
case, neurons within insula paying attention stressed are,
alert are, tired are. really inward focusing structure. focuses
feel internally. not surprisingly, taste system sends information
insular cortex give us sense, literally, ingested, whether not
tasting tastes good not. will return insular cortex moments.
important thing understand, neurons areas cortex,
cortex mine, respond particular tastes providing internal
representation external sense. mean that? don't want
abstract. take foods, break mouth chewing them,
sucking them, whatever food happens be, chemicals bind
receptors, electrical signals sent brain, just electrical
signals, just like notes played keys piano. no unique signature
salty sweet. relative activation one set neurons activated
sweet, another set neurons activated umami. relative activation
traveling brain in, essentially, form, electrical signals.
really incredible, right? Electrical signals sent brain, say, aha,
sweet want it, bitter, want less it, umami flavored,
really, really like that, really like savory foods, happen to.

immediately strike incredible, means
representation want less electrical nature. really
tamp issue down, studies done Charles Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R...


absolutely phenomenal neuroscientist Columbia University New York. Studies done
Zuker Lab shown that, first all, identify neurons
cortex deep brain respond sweet taste bitter taste. turns out,
non-overlapping populations neurons. using molecular tricks,
able either silence activate neurons that, instance, respond
sweet. this, see incredible consequences perception that, indeed,
occur brain, brain well, time without kind
manipulations. experiment. subject drink water contains
sugar, drink water contains salty substance, drink water contains bitter
substance, instance. Okay, sort paraphrasing large amount work.
identify neurons respond sweet tastes. see, many researchers
seen, subjects prefer sweet taste tastes, certainly, sweet tastes
bitter, sweet tastes nothing, plain water. go in,
able selectively silence neurons represent sweet. that,
eliminate preference sweet taste. Now, might seem obvious, neurons
respond sweet, silence neurons, no longer seek sweet.
strike you, also, incredible, not actually changing
happening tongue deeper layers brain. Conversely, can
subjects drink bitter water plain water activating, selectively activating,
neurons respond sweet. find, subjects will actively
prefer bitter plain water actual preferences, sweet. means
that, perception like central, meaning deep within brain,
phenomenon. not things taste mouth. Now, course,
normal conditions, aren't experimental manipulations done,
things positively correlated. Sweet tastes trigger activation sweet
neurons, instance. Neurons mouth respond umami, trigger activation
neurons brain respond umami, forth. correlated

interesting neurons, essentially doing, providing
subconscious signal quality food eating, contains,
triggering release molecule within brain, dopamine, leads
go seek foods. Now, profound impact number things. First
all, consideration so-called hidden sugars. Dr. Robert Lustig,

prominent researchers talk fact so-called hidden

necessarily taste sweet delicious, activating subconscious
mechanisms driving pursue foods. sounds like
diabolical strategy, indeed, somewhat diabolical strategy. However,
neurons also involved signaling brain when, instance, eating

immediate long-term brain health, like shift gears somewhat, talk
like foods like. heard hardwired
pursue sugar, like fatty foods, calorie-rich foods attractive us
sorts reasons, know, surviving famines, things sort.
true, actual mechanisms underlie food seeking food preference far
interesting that. basically three channels body nervous
system decide foods pursue, much eat, whether not
will find particular food attractive, whether not will want consume
it, whether not want avoid it, whether not just sort so-so, refer
yum, yuck, meh analysis. indeed, nervous system
respect food. trying figure whether not, yum, want
this, yuck, want avoid this, meh, so-so. Now, may seem like overly
simplified version food seeking food preference, actually not far
truth. actually correctly captures much biology food preference. talk
three channels food preference are. first one obvious
one. taste mouth. sensation foods eat
chewing them, sensations, literally just somatosensory,
touch sensations, know, palatability food relates consistency
food, important. heard before, sensors tongue
elsewhere mouth detect various chemicals contained within food,
lead senses taste, call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, sour. Now,
us familiar sense bitterness comes something like raw
radish, sweet, comes, obviously, sugars different kinds, fructose, glucose,
et cetera, salty, salty, sour, think lemon lemon juice, instance.
mentioned umami. umami receptor receptor responds savory taste
things. might find really wonderfully rich tomato sauce.
eat meat, like meat, really well cooked ,not necessarily well done,
properly cooked, say, steak, thing. umami present
plant animal foods, gives us sensation savoriness. almost kind
little bit briny taste it, braised taste it. indeed, brazing meats
brazing vegetables done specifically activate umami receptor.
five basic tastes. chemical sensors tongue that, call,
transduce chemicals. chemicals, literally, food bind receptors,
transduced, meaning binding chemicals receptors


converted electrical signal travels tongue along called
gustatory nerve. gustatory nerve synapses, meaning makes connections
brainstem so-called nucleus solitary tract. nuclei back

called insular cortex, insula. want highlight insula episode,

alert are, tired are. really inward focusing structure. focuses
feel internally. not surprisingly, taste system sends information
insular cortex give us sense, literally, ingested, whether not
tasting tastes good not. will return insular cortex moments.
important thing understand, neurons areas cortex,
cortex mine, respond particular tastes providing internal

abstract. take foods, break mouth chewing them,
sucking them, whatever food happens be, chemicals bind
receptors, electrical signals sent brain, just electrical
signals, just like notes played keys piano. no unique signature
salty sweet. relative activation one set neurons activated
sweet, another set neurons activated umami. relative activation
traveling brain in, essentially, form, electrical signals.
really incredible, right? Electrical signals sent brain, say, aha,
sweet want it, bitter, want less it, umami flavored,
really, really like that, really like savory foods, happen to.

tamp issue down, studies done Charles Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R...


absolutely phenomenal neuroscientist Columbia University New York. Studies done
Zuker Lab shown that, first all, identify neurons
cortex deep brain respond sweet taste bitter taste. turns out,
non-overlapping populations neurons. using molecular tricks,
able either silence activate neurons that, instance, respond
sweet. this, see incredible consequences perception that, indeed,
occur brain, brain well, time without kind
manipulations. experiment. subject drink water contains
sugar, drink water contains salty substance, drink water contains bitter
substance, instance. Okay, sort paraphrasing large amount work.
identify neurons respond sweet tastes. see, many researchers
seen, subjects prefer sweet taste tastes, certainly, sweet tastes
bitter, sweet tastes nothing, plain water. go in,
able selectively silence neurons represent sweet. that,
eliminate preference sweet taste. Now, might seem obvious, neurons
respond sweet, silence neurons, no longer seek sweet.
strike you, also, incredible, not actually changing
happening tongue deeper layers brain. Conversely, can
subjects drink bitter water plain water activating, selectively activating,
neurons respond sweet. find, subjects will actively
prefer bitter plain water actual preferences, sweet. means
that, perception like central, meaning deep within brain,
phenomenon. not things taste mouth. Now, course,
normal conditions, aren't experimental manipulations done,
things positively correlated. Sweet tastes trigger activation sweet
neurons, instance. Neurons mouth respond umami, trigger activation
neurons brain respond umami, forth. correlated
way makes seek things like, avoid things don't
like. see minutes, turns out, not direct relationship

interesting neurons, essentially doing, providing
subconscious signal quality food eating, contains,
triggering release molecule within brain, dopamine, leads
go seek foods. Now, profound impact number things. First
all, consideration so-called hidden sugars. Dr. Robert Lustig,
pediatric endocrinologist University California, San Francisco, among
prominent researchers talk fact so-called hidden

called hidden sugars. not just put fun.
sugars placed processed foods designed trigger activation
mechanisms lead want eat foods, not
necessarily taste sweet delicious, activating subconscious
mechanisms driving pursue foods. sounds like
diabolical strategy, indeed, somewhat diabolical strategy. However,
neurons also involved signaling brain when, instance, eating
food rich omega-3 fatty acids, fatty acids talking earlier.

therefore, no increase brain metabolism, dopamine levels eventually start rise.
dopamine levels eventually start rise, essentially conditioned

therefore, no increase brain metabolism, dopamine levels eventually start rise.
dopamine levels eventually start rise, essentially conditioned

that, consuming artificial sweeteners, consuming longer

foods eating can actually impact foods will taste, maybe
not immediately, eventually, can impact way body utilizes
foods. Now, might seem like absolute pipe dream. just imagine like
mackerel, mackerel will start taste good. not saying that. didn't say
override yuck signals mechanism. didn't say take food
absolutely noxious you, make want vomit, override that.
However, foods somewhat neutral can take different value based
activation dopamine system. now, knowing know,
couple ways imagine that. First all, could, so-called
gedanken, thought experiment, could, instance, swap sucralose,
sucralose just taste, right? artificial sweet taste. swap out,
insert kale, eat kale something raises blood glucose degree
another. Now, not encouraging anyone run spike blood glucose

are, listed beginning episode, justification
list. means is, obviously, want consume foods


like, brain health important, many foods promote
brain health, perhaps, not palatable desirable you, key
ingest foods want ingest simply
good you, not taste good you, alongside foods increase
whatever fuel system happen relying on. think nutritionally
politically correct way say it. keto, mean ketones, okay?
not ketogenic, think people probably not ketosis, trying
maintain ketosis, instance, people purely plant-based diet,
one set foods. people omnivores, different set foods.
people carnivores, yet another set foods. want eat
particular food good you, pair something meal.
don't hide physically, flavor sense. don't hide within
food, pair food provides shift brain metabolism,
really brain seeking, even though don't realize
it. long will take? Well, according data humans sucralose
conditioning sucralose effects, which, many cases, detrimental,
right? increasing insulin. case, trying hijack
conditioning food preference healthy purposes, not sucralose, ingesting
things good you, data really point fact even within short
period time seven days, certainly within 14 days, food will take
subjective experience tasting least better you, not good you. Now, believe
important implications much controversy food wars see
there. Food wars being, course, groups ardently subscribe idea
diet things eating foods good us,
pleasureful, things everyone eating. see
every community within nutrition realm. Now, course, studies
point fact certain foods food components healthier, probably us
planet, really see ends spectrum. got people
pure carnivore diet arguing lot biomedical evidence
best us beneficial. got people arguing
general sets arguments, purely plant-based diet. think
people fall omnivore category. clear, however,
consume regular basis leads increases brain metabolism leads
increases dopamine, thereby motivation eat them. really says,


tend regularly becomes reinforcing itself. think,
large part, can explain fact that, yes, indeed, certain people, given diet not
feels good, heavily subscribe nutrient kind health beneficial effects
diet. often will provide evidence that, whether not ask
not. true every subcategory within nutrition realm. Again, not
take away beautiful data emphasizing certain foods,
micronutrients, et cetera, better us, worse us, planet. not
debate want get right now. emphasizes, foods impact
brain health, also impact brain functions responds food,
largely learned response. can't completely override, instance,
certain foods evoke strong, [grunts] yuck component. Certain foods truly putrid
us. just say, certain things putrid us, not consume them,
right? far end spectrum, hard-wired us avoid those,
can dangerous us. can make us very, sick. also true,
continue eat foods progressively sweeter sweeter highly palatable,
shifts dopamine system, activates dopamine system make us
believe foods foods can trigger reward system,
make us feel good, taste good. consuming foods perhaps
less sweet even less savory, not call highly, say,
nowadays, super palatable foods, can adjust sense literally
perceive attractive rewarding food, indeed, dopamine system

will reward foods accordingly. can't emphasize enough much learning
associated food reward important not just understanding like foods
eat, eat foods healthy us, enjoy them, also
speaks fact brain, whole, perceptual device trying make

don't just like sweet foods taste good, like
predict certain kind metabolic response. important also, Dana
Small, Ivan de Araujo, others exploring whether not people,
instance, type 2 diabetes, suffer number different metabolic
disorders, whether not somehow food reward systems permanently


disrupted, beautiful set experiments done mainly

ingest artificial sweeteners, even though no increase blood glucose level,
therefore, no increase brain metabolism, dopamine levels eventually start rise.
dopamine levels eventually start rise, essentially conditioned
reinforced artificial non-caloric sweetener, subjects start consume
