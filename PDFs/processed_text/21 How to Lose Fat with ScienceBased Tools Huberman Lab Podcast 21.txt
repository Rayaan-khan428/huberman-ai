fat loss something interests large number people. Many people want
lose fat, many people athletes need lose fat. general, know
body fat percentages high unhealthy us. people
struggle lose fat. people struggled lose weight generally, people
especially struggled lose body fat call adipose tissue. Now, huge

00:08:44 First Law Fat Loss

neurons vastly overlooked discussion losing fat. Now,
remiss probably come pretty considerable attack, didn't just
acknowledge upfront core truth metabolic science also neuroscience, frankly,
calories versus calories out, meaning many calories ingest,
versus many calories burn fundamental important formula
business fat loss weight management general. simply no way
around fact ingest far calories burn, likely gain
weight. good portion weight likely adipose tissue fat. also true
ingest fewer calories burn, will lose weight,
significant portion will come body fat. portion? Depends number
factors. simple formula important. previous episode, mentioned
complications statements calorie calorie. indeed evidence
instance Robert Lustig, pediatric endocrinologist UC San Francisco
talked highly processed foods change way utilize food,
can lead higher incidences obesity metabolic syndromes go

research literature shows want get thousand milligrams
EPA per day, can best support metabolism position
good fat loss. well people cravings issues, crave
sweets time, talked gut-brain episode hormones food.
neurons gut craving, seeking essential fatty acids
craving seeking amino acids food. Now, not
supplements crave per se, craving things
body needs brain needs. neurons will respond sugars.


many people craving sugar can satisfy sugar craving giving
neurons speak actually want, amino acids essential fatty
acids. includes EPA, also things like glutamine amino acid can really
reduce sugar cravings take teaspoon that, even tablespoon
times day. ease little bit, people can get little
bit GI distress much glutamine. glutamine also shown
improve symptoms leaky gut. powerful amino acid. yes, can also get
food. Things like cottage cheese high glutamine, et cetera. finally
can't really position strong metabolism iodine levels aren't
correct, thyroid levels aren't correct. can overdo iodine. don't want
that. lot table salt iodine added it, people need add iodine,
ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.. one best ways support thyroid
system metabolism general, make sure getting enough selenium.
Sometimes called selenium day. Simple way ingest highest
concentration selenium food aware of, Brazil nuts, one two three
per day. enough selenium meet thyroid needs.
don't want selenium high, don't want diet high anything.
again, sleep, sufficient EPAs, glutamine issues leaky gut sugar
cravings can really help. Get gut microbiome, right? may missed saying that,
get gut microbiome right. not necessarily mean need ingest
probiotics. can, want to, can also just simply ingest serving two
fermented foods per day, can greatly assess. things like sauerkraut, kimchi,
every culture different source sources fermented foods, can really help
gut microbiome, make sure thyroid hormone supported
ingestion sufficient iodine not much sufficient selenium, not much.
Okay? Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods, iodine selenium. sets
basis things like exercise, cold compounds things
going talk today guessing going truly new many
can really increase burn factor equation

convert energy, don't oxidize it, can returned body fat. many


things nervous system can do, increase mobilization fat, also
oxidation fat. Okay? two opportunities burn fat,
opportunities governed nervous system. neurons literally send little
wires call axons fat release chemicals provide stimulus
fat mobilized, later fat burned up. Okay?
go really deep this, not going go much deeper that,
isn't biochemistry fatty acid metabolism lecture. burn fat

oxidation step. think anyone you, able internalize that.
Mobilize oxidize.

00:32:25 Critical Role Adrenaline/Epinephrine, NOT Adrenal Glands

Okay? Mobilize oxidize. neurons connect fat doing?
releasing exactly? actually increase fat mobilization?
increase fat oxidation? Burning fat. Well, couple things

can major effect fat loss raises second tool. low,
meaning small movements engage trigger epinephrin adrenaline
release neurons sympathetic nervous system innervate fat
increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation
fatty acids. recent years growing interest use cold
various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism, recovery


exercise. talked number things uses cold
podcast. fact, episode supercharge performance palmer
cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going
get increased metabolic effect, not going get succinate
release. want get body heat, thermogenic level go up, need
shiver. now NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis. low
levels activity described before, done away cold, maybe
cold well. well shiver response cold. shiver valuable
triggering release succinate. fact, succinate evolved now various
drug manufacturers potential treatment obesity. Although hasn't really hit
market final form yet.



00:52:26 Exact Protocols: (1-5X per week); Don’t Adapt! Submerge Exit “Sets &

Succinate powerful effects brown fat. many times week
need expose cold? Will depend much fat trying lose,
much trying increase metabolism. studies describe

ice bath cold water. doesn't actually ice it, provided
cold enough anytime, anywhere, excuse me, one five times per week.
turns just one exposure per week can valuable. question
long get cold environment? cold environment be?
first talk long get cold environment? answer
might little bit different might imagine. might think, oh, well
one minute good, three minutes better, three minutes better 10
minutes best. remember goal get shiver induced release succinate,
succinate can trigger brown fat. turns want trigger

get cold water, two factors will dictate whether not shiver.
Probably three, just talk main two. One, cold is. cold

tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.

reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

lose fat, many people athletes need lose fat. general, know
body fat percentages high unhealthy us. people
struggle lose fat. people struggled lose weight generally, people
especially struggled lose body fat call adipose tissue. Now, huge
topic internet. lot controversy. Today, going talk
things related fat loss, powerful fat loss guessing
never heard before. may heard them,
guessing haven't heard them. episode going rich
science-based tools gleaned variety aspects literature, including
use cold, including brown fat, including something called beige fat. going
talk something called NEAT. going talk sorts aspects fat

00:08:44 First Law Fat Loss

neurons vastly overlooked discussion losing fat. Now,
remiss probably come pretty considerable attack, didn't just
acknowledge upfront core truth metabolic science also neuroscience, frankly,
calories versus calories out, meaning many calories ingest,
versus many calories burn fundamental important formula
business fat loss weight management general. simply no way
around fact ingest far calories burn, likely gain
weight. good portion weight likely adipose tissue fat. also true
ingest fewer calories burn, will lose weight,
significant portion will come body fat. portion? Depends number
factors. simple formula important. previous episode, mentioned
complications statements calorie calorie. indeed evidence
instance Robert Lustig, pediatric endocrinologist UC San Francisco
talked highly processed foods change way utilize food,
can lead higher incidences obesity metabolic syndromes go
idea calorie calorie it. calorie calorie unit
energy, need accept acknowledge calories in, meaning calories
ingested versus calories burned formula. calories burn portion strongly
influenced number things can control can greatly accelerate
increase amount adipose tissue proportion adipose tissue burn
response exercise food. hormones important. thermogenic
milieu, meaning warm cold body is? cold make it, warm
make it? also level metabolism. levels thyroid hormone

00:11:00 Neurons Connect Fat! (& Really Matters)

something hardly ever discussed, well supported scientific
literature, much innervation? Meaning much connectivity is,
nervous system fat. Today, going talk fact body fat
various kinds, several kinds body fat actually innervated
neurons. Neurons connect body fat can change probability body


fat will burned not. nervous system master controller process,
plays strong role calories out, calories burned component.
usual, going discuss little bit science. promise won't go deep
lipolysis sorts things related fat oxidation. going break
process two important steps. can understand two important steps
rest tools will straightforward understand manage.
believe today will walk away many new tools incorporate
kind fat loss regimen will greatly accelerate process,
grounded quality peer-reviewed science. Throughout episode, going talk
behavioral tools. fact, mostly talk behavioral tools. will also talk
compound, supplements. Many supplements. aren't,
fine. supplements, important issue
discussion supplements fat loss otherwise going quality

thing essential fatty acids. talked food mood episode,
also talked hormones episodes. need fatty acids. vital
many aspects health. don't get supplements. can,
want to, need get food. essential.
reason E essential part there. fatty acids, multiple kinds,
antidepressant effects levels fatty acids will promote good
mood also healthy metabolism start shift needle right direction
bloodborne cardiovascular factors. key thing get levels EPA
ingest 1000 milligrams per day. doesn't mean just taking thousand
milligrams say fish oil krill oil whatever preferred source is. means
getting thousand milligrams EPA may require ingest
essential fatty acids just thousand milligrams per day. course can done
food sources, things like fatty fish, not eating fish, quality
meats grass raised can that. sources essential fatty acids,
course also plant sources. look, online. really easy find.
research literature shows want get thousand milligrams
EPA per day, can best support metabolism position
good fat loss. well people cravings issues, crave
sweets time, talked gut-brain episode hormones food.
neurons gut craving, seeking essential fatty acids
craving seeking amino acids food. Now, not
supplements crave per se, craving things
body needs brain needs. neurons will respond sugars.


many people craving sugar can satisfy sugar craving giving
neurons speak actually want, amino acids essential fatty
acids. includes EPA, also things like glutamine amino acid can really
reduce sugar cravings take teaspoon that, even tablespoon
times day. ease little bit, people can get little
bit GI distress much glutamine. glutamine also shown
improve symptoms leaky gut. powerful amino acid. yes, can also get
food. Things like cottage cheese high glutamine, et cetera. finally
can't really position strong metabolism iodine levels aren't
correct, thyroid levels aren't correct. can overdo iodine. don't want
that. lot table salt iodine added it, people need add iodine,
ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.. one best ways support thyroid
system metabolism general, make sure getting enough selenium.
Sometimes called selenium day. Simple way ingest highest
concentration selenium food aware of, Brazil nuts, one two three
per day. enough selenium meet thyroid needs.
don't want selenium high, don't want diet high anything.
again, sleep, sufficient EPAs, glutamine issues leaky gut sugar
cravings can really help. Get gut microbiome, right? may missed saying that,
get gut microbiome right. not necessarily mean need ingest
probiotics. can, want to, can also just simply ingest serving two
fermented foods per day, can greatly assess. things like sauerkraut, kimchi,
every culture different source sources fermented foods, can really help
gut microbiome, make sure thyroid hormone supported
ingestion sufficient iodine not much sufficient selenium, not much.
Okay? Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods, iodine selenium. sets
basis things like exercise, cold compounds things
going talk today guessing going truly new many
can really increase burn factor equation

00:19:20 Mindset Truly Matters: Amazing Examples Beliefs Fat Loss

calories versus calories burned. Okay? one hand reality
calories in, versus calories burned. However, also remiss didn't mention


incredible study done colleague, Alia Crum Stanford. faculty
member, professor psychology department. Looking belief affects, just
thinking can impact effects things like exercise weight loss. just
incredible results. took subjects hotel service people
clean hotels come change linens forth. Divide
two groups. One group, told moving around duties

hard fast rule governs fat loss weight loss,
ingest calories burn, either maintain gain weight. Typically,
gain weight, although not always. ingest many calories burn,

00:23:08 Brain Talks Fat

increase rates fat loss. going talk today. love
topic not obsessed fat loss, rather first project
ever worked science thermogenesis fat loss. joined laboratory
undergraduate, guy worked loved explore new compounds
impacted thermogenesis. looked things like MDMA/Ecstasy,
antipsychotics, antidepressants, various weight loss drugs market.
impacted body temperature fat loss metabolism? just
much fun it. detect smile face, about.
also learned lot, also came really appreciate tissue bodies,
adipose tissue fat, think just unfortunate thing like told
core energy source ever entered famine true, et cetera. come
realize cells body, fuel furnace body,
metabolism. third player. really gets
interesting. nervous system, neurons opportunity turn intensity
furnace. opportunity increase amount heat produce
therefore amount energy burn. also really intrigued
something that, growing up, think know people can eat tone
never seem gain body fat. people seem eat little seem gain
body fat easily. always intrigued that. turns
number different factors relate that. nervous system one
can really control.

00:25:00 Incredible & Dangerous Fat Loss Agent

losed, excuse me, lost lot weight, significant portion weight without
changing anything else doing, eating, et cetera. turned
compound something called Dinitrophenol, DNP. years
Dinatrophenol, DNP gained popularity niche cultures, mainly bodybuilders,
athletes even modeling industry. absolutely terrible compound anyone
use, highly fatal body temperature goes high. Hyperthermia will
kill you. indeed many people died using Dinatrophenol weight loss drug
attempting use weight loss drug. Dinitophenol really illustrates principle

et cetera. body temperature way utilize energy controlled
nervous system. way Dinatrophenol works changing neurons
way neurons connect fat change way fat burns up.

00:27:28 Losing Fat Two-Part Process: Mobilization Oxidation

not going suggest, not suggesting use Dinatrophenol.
However, things can can change relationship
neurons fat body ways can powerfully accelerate
fat loss. don't know don't hear things more, probably
see internet focuses
eat eat shouldn't eat. concentrates exercise regimens will
also talk about. burn factor, thermogenic environment one the, not
important factors business fat loss. since neuroscientist
going talk about. talk fat utilization. talk


fat converted energy sometimes also called fat burning. like
know two-part process. Okay? reality, many
biochemical steps. log onto internet, open textbook
want learn fat utilization, going see lot chemistry. happy
go deep chemistry like. think probably interested
leverage points? can exert control process ways
benefit you? going focus mainly those. Okay? not upset
aficionados will put nomenclature, go. two parts
process. One, fat mobilization. second fat oxidation utilization. Okay?
first thing happen body fat get burned used reduced

visceral organs can subcutaneous skin. people thinking
subcutaneous fat think fat. deal. want
detail, great, touch bit. basically stored fat two parts
relevant here. got fatty acid part, part body can use.

haven't burned fat yet, just moved fat cells.
going go cells can use energy. inside cells,
still not burned up. need oxidize them. Think oxidation burnup part.
need moved mitochondria can converted ATP
energy. just really zoom make sure don't lose anybody. got
mobilize fat, oxidize fat. words, mobilize
it, actually convert energy. just mobilize it, don't
convert energy, don't oxidize it, can returned body fat. many


things nervous system can do, increase mobilization fat, also
oxidation fat. Okay? two opportunities burn fat,
opportunities governed nervous system. neurons literally send little
wires call axons fat release chemicals provide stimulus
fat mobilized, later fat burned up. Okay?
go really deep this, not going go much deeper that,
isn't biochemistry fatty acid metabolism lecture. burn fat
using nervous system. remember, mobilization step,
oxidation step. think anyone you, able internalize that.
Mobilize oxidize.

00:32:25 Critical Role Adrenaline/Epinephrine, NOT Adrenal Glands

Okay? Mobilize oxidize. neurons connect fat doing?
releasing exactly? actually increase fat mobilization?
increase fat oxidation? Burning fat. Well, couple things
release encourage process. main one need know
epinephrine adrenaline. conversion fatty acids ATP
mitochondria cells favored adrenaline. Okay? adrenaline released
two sources. Adrenaline released adrenal glands, set top kidneys
lower back. also released so-called sympathetic nervous
system. Although name bit misnomer, nothing

big mistake literature finally corrected among know.
mistake literature adrenal glands release adrenaline

00:44:55 Two Ways Using Shivering Accelerate Fat Loss

can major effect fat loss raises second tool. low,
meaning small movements engage trigger epinephrin adrenaline
release neurons sympathetic nervous system innervate fat
increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation
fatty acids. recent years growing interest use cold
various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism, recovery


exercise. talked number things uses cold
podcast. fact, episode supercharge performance palmer
cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going
get increased metabolic effect, not going get succinate
release. want get body heat, thermogenic level go up, need
shiver. now NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis. low
levels activity described before, done away cold, maybe
cold well. well shiver response cold. shiver valuable
triggering release succinate. fact, succinate evolved now various
drug manufacturers potential treatment obesity. Although hasn't really hit
market final form yet.



00:52:26 Exact Protocols: (1-5X per week); Don’t Adapt! Submerge Exit “Sets &

without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.

reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps

moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,

using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat

almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going

science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy

elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food

fasted. probably not eaten anything anywhere three 24
hours maybe even more. also fasted afternoon.
lunch noon four five 6:00 p.m. it, will burn fat exercise
without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.
1976, goes way back, glucose reduces fat burning exercise.
studies want look up, easy find
PubMed. put Horowitz 1999, [indistinct] another one people
drink milk glucose it. sweet sugary milk exercise, et cetera.
can find number examples eating exercise reduces amount fat
oxidized exercise. can also find lot studies showing that,
eating exercise prior exercise will not reduce amount fat
oxidized. However, types exercise whether medium intensity high
intensity low intensity map studies. hard target
ideal protocol. look really deep literature, start find meta

exercise. switchover point whereby ate exercise, will
reduce, excuse me, will burn far less fat 90 minute point onward
gone training fasted. let repeat that. moderate
intensity, so-called zone two cardio type exercise, 90 minute point, happen
eaten exercise within one three hours prior exercise,
reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior
exercise. 90 minute point, 90 minutes exercise will start burn
fat eaten. Now, 90 minutes moderate intensity exercises

lot hiking. However, people going hiking day

made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity

fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling

makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat
burning overall. look percentage body fat burned,
look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training

breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps

increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol

taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't

adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning

also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going

minute mile, lot running, lot swimming. lot walking,
lot hiking. However, people going hiking day
running day walking day. want burn fat per unit time,

01:18:15 High-Intensity Training Done First, Benefits Fasting Arrive

want oxidize fat fasted. Now, also studies
pointed fact don't wait 90 minutes order get
enhanced fat burning effect. studies able find looked like
quality peer-reviewed studies no company bias no product bias kind.
studies largely funded federal government university
context pointed fact one high-intensity training, even high
intensity forms training like sprints squats deadlifts kind activity
can't maintained these, know, eight say 60
seconds. set lifting weights repeated, repeated, done anywhere
20 minutes, weight training power lifting kinds things kettlebell
swings 60 minutes, switchover point can burn
fat, go fasted comes earlier. makes sense
nothing holy 90 minute point medium intensity Zone 2 cardio. 90
minute point point body shifts mainly burning glycogen,
basically, sugar comes muscles liver realizes going
while, going shift storage site fuel reserve like body fat.
going happen while, going start tapping body fat stores. Now, fat


doesn't little brain there. innervated neurons, doesn't thoughts.

milieu various hormones. happen insulin go far
enough. ate exercise, increase insulin, ate
carbohydrates bigger increase insulin, fat proteins indeed
lower amounts insulin fasting will give lowest amount insulin. Well,
switch point going come earlier exercise. think
something high intensity 20, 30, 40 minutes, maybe lift weights
get Zone 2 cardio. fasted, literature says going
burn body fat per unit time eaten exercise.
mean? means want burn body fat,
protocols approved safely, exercise intensely 20 60
minutes, higher intensity obviously shorter going be,
move Zone 2 cardio. fasted medium intensity cardio
say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage
body fat. need eat like eat train also can work.
train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue
intensely exercise therefore fuel source drawing from. hopefully
made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long
period time shift burning fat. indeed seems going
fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low
carbohydrates higher carbs, that. general, theme simple.
want insulin levels pretty low goal body fat reduction,
want oxidize body fat. fasting cases, fat fasting cases
just ingesting fats. Fat protein, cases people will
eating carbohydrates. not dictate particular nutrition regimen.



01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat
burning overall. look percentage body fat burned,
look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training
followed low intensity training even just followed going back life

01:26:05 Protocol Exercise-Induced Fat Loss; Adrenalin Effector

three four times week high intensity training followed either nothing
followed low intensity training especially able fasted.
just mention none stuff fasted performance. want

today optimize body fat loss. train moderately high intensity
moderate low intensity, train moderate high intensity, go

training. breathing really hard, goal always says is, want
breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement
kind, whether not low level shiver, whether not lifting barbell sprinting

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps

benefit you? going focus mainly those. Okay? not upset
aficionados will put nomenclature, go. two parts
process. One, fat mobilization. second fat oxidation utilization. Okay?
first thing happen body fat get burned used reduced
get mobilized. process called lipolysis, actually don't care
know name lipolysis, just move fat position
in. get fat cells. right? Fat cells can visceral around
visceral organs can subcutaneous skin. people thinking
subcutaneous fat think fat. deal. want
detail, great, touch bit. basically stored fat two parts
relevant here. got fatty acid part, part body can use.
attached something called glycerol linked backbone.
already, probably much chemistry you. want want

haven't burned fat yet, just moved fat cells.
going go cells can use energy. inside cells,
still not burned up. need oxidize them. Think oxidation burnup part.
need moved mitochondria can converted ATP
energy. just really zoom make sure don't lose anybody. got
mobilize fat, oxidize fat. words, mobilize
it, actually convert energy. just mobilize it, don't
convert energy, don't oxidize it, can returned body fat. many


things nervous system can do, increase mobilization fat, also
oxidation fat. Okay? two opportunities burn fat,
opportunities governed nervous system. neurons literally send little
wires call axons fat release chemicals provide stimulus
fat mobilized, later fat burned up. Okay?
go really deep this, not going go much deeper that,
isn't biochemistry fatty acid metabolism lecture. burn fat
using nervous system. remember, mobilization step,
oxidation step. think anyone you, able internalize that.
Mobilize oxidize.

00:32:25 Critical Role Adrenaline/Epinephrine, NOT Adrenal Glands

Okay? Mobilize oxidize. neurons connect fat doing?
releasing exactly? actually increase fat mobilization?
increase fat oxidation? Burning fat. Well, couple things
release encourage process. main one need know
epinephrine adrenaline. conversion fatty acids ATP
mitochondria cells favored adrenaline. Okay? adrenaline released
two sources. Adrenaline released adrenal glands, set top kidneys
lower back. also released so-called sympathetic nervous

caffeine adapted. talked earlier episode want make sure
clear this. not used drinking caffeine suddenly decide
going drink big cup coffee training, will vasoconstrict will limit

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately

States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger

can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage

mobilize fat, oxidize fat. words, mobilize
it, actually convert energy. just mobilize it, don't
convert energy, don't oxidize it, can returned body fat. many


things nervous system can do, increase mobilization fat, also
oxidation fat. Okay? two opportunities burn fat,
opportunities governed nervous system. neurons literally send little

can major effect fat loss raises second tool. low,
meaning small movements engage trigger epinephrin adrenaline
release neurons sympathetic nervous system innervate fat
increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation
fatty acids. recent years growing interest use cold
various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism, recovery


exercise. talked number things uses cold
podcast. fact, episode supercharge performance palmer
cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental

mobilize fat, oxidize fat. words, mobilize
it, actually convert energy. just mobilize it, don't
convert energy, don't oxidize it, can returned body fat. many


things nervous system can do, increase mobilization fat, also
oxidation fat. Okay? two opportunities burn fat,
opportunities governed nervous system. neurons literally send little
wires call axons fat release chemicals provide stimulus
fat mobilized, later fat burned up. Okay?
go really deep this, not going go much deeper that,
isn't biochemistry fatty acid metabolism lecture. burn fat

oxidation step. think anyone you, able internalize that.
Mobilize oxidize.

00:32:25 Critical Role Adrenaline/Epinephrine, NOT Adrenal Glands

Okay? Mobilize oxidize. neurons connect fat doing?
releasing exactly? actually increase fat mobilization?
increase fat oxidation? Burning fat. Well, couple things

can major effect fat loss raises second tool. low,
meaning small movements engage trigger epinephrin adrenaline
release neurons sympathetic nervous system innervate fat
increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation
fatty acids. recent years growing interest use cold
various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism, recovery


exercise. talked number things uses cold
podcast. fact, episode supercharge performance palmer
cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going
get increased metabolic effect, not going get succinate
release. want get body heat, thermogenic level go up, need
shiver. now NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis. low

fasted. probably not eaten anything anywhere three 24
hours maybe even more. also fasted afternoon.
lunch noon four five 6:00 p.m. it, will burn fat exercise
without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.
1976, goes way back, glucose reduces fat burning exercise.
studies want look up, easy find
PubMed. put Horowitz 1999, [indistinct] another one people
drink milk glucose it. sweet sugary milk exercise, et cetera.
can find number examples eating exercise reduces amount fat
oxidized exercise. can also find lot studies showing that,
eating exercise prior exercise will not reduce amount fat
oxidized. However, types exercise whether medium intensity high

eaten exercise within one three hours prior exercise,
reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior
exercise. 90 minute point, 90 minutes exercise will start burn

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat

breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement

using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat

Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose

look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training
followed low intensity training even just followed going back life

01:26:05 Protocol Exercise-Induced Fat Loss; Adrenalin Effector

going best way continue burn body fat ways
increases basal metabolic rate. distilled simple protocol whereby
three four times week high intensity training followed either nothing
followed low intensity training especially able fasted.
just mention none stuff fasted performance. want
perform really well, reasons performance want to, know,
sport competition, not body fat purposes. Well, kind falls
away modified ideal eat performance. talking
today optimize body fat loss. train moderately high intensity
moderate low intensity, train moderate high intensity, go
life. fact, friend uses strategy. likes train intensely
not often protocol cause busy person. train 20 30 minutes
intensely weights just body weight movement lot, burpees
push-ups sit-ups pull-ups just kind moving kind circuit type
training. breathing really hard, goal always says is, want
breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement
kind, whether not low level shiver, whether not lifting barbell sprinting

mainly increasing amount epinephrin released neurons
innovate fat tissue. One common ones one may already using
caffeine. well-established caffeine can enhance performance,
caffeine adapted. talked earlier episode want make sure
clear this. not used drinking caffeine suddenly decide
going drink big cup coffee training, will vasoconstrict will limit
performance. performance. caffeine adapted however, kind
interesting phenomenon ingestion caffeine serves performance
enhancer, increasing alertness, also way dilating vasculature
allowing blood flow. Now, caffeine burning fat oxidizing mobilizing
fat interesting one. can effective dosages 400 milligrams.

feel drinking 100 200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams caffeine training.
indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps
much training really, really intensely. bottom line is, like


caffeine can use safely, ingesting somewhere 104 milligrams
caffeine prior exercise somewhere 30 40 minutes exercise can

can major effect fat loss raises second tool. low,
meaning small movements engage trigger epinephrin adrenaline
release neurons sympathetic nervous system innervate fat
increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation
fatty acids. recent years growing interest use cold
various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism, recovery


exercise. talked number things uses cold
podcast. fact, episode supercharge performance palmer
cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going
get increased metabolic effect, not going get succinate
release. want get body heat, thermogenic level go up, need
shiver. now NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis. low
levels activity described before, done away cold, maybe
cold well. well shiver response cold. shiver valuable
triggering release succinate. fact, succinate evolved now various
drug manufacturers potential treatment obesity. Although hasn't really hit
market final form yet.



00:52:26 Exact Protocols: (1-5X per week); Don’t Adapt! Submerge Exit “Sets &
Reps”

Succinate powerful effects brown fat. many times week
need expose cold? Will depend much fat trying lose,
much trying increase metabolism. studies describe
positive effects fat loss exposing cold, either cold shower
ice bath cold water. doesn't actually ice it, provided
cold enough anytime, anywhere, excuse me, one five times per week.
turns just one exposure per week can valuable. question
long get cold environment? cold environment be?
first talk long get cold environment? answer
might little bit different might imagine. might think, oh, well
one minute good, three minutes better, three minutes better 10
minutes best. remember goal get shiver induced release succinate,
succinate can trigger brown fat. turns want trigger
shiver, want get cold get cold
typically not dry off, get back cold cold, will definitely

increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation
fatty acids. recent years growing interest use cold
various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving metabolism, recovery


exercise. talked number things uses cold
podcast. fact, episode supercharge performance palmer
cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going
get increased metabolic effect, not going get succinate
release. want get body heat, thermogenic level go up, need
shiver. now NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis. low
levels activity described before, done away cold, maybe
cold well. well shiver response cold. shiver valuable

drug manufacturers potential treatment obesity. Although hasn't really hit
market final form yet.

lot. pretty long run. Even running pretty slow pace like 10 12
minute mile, lot running, lot swimming. lot walking,
lot hiking. However, people going hiking day
running day walking day. want burn fat per unit time,

01:18:15 High-Intensity Training Done First, Benefits Fasting Arrive

want oxidize fat fasted. Now, also studies
pointed fact don't wait 90 minutes order get
enhanced fat burning effect. studies able find looked like
quality peer-reviewed studies no company bias no product bias kind.
studies largely funded federal government university
context pointed fact one high-intensity training, even high
intensity forms training like sprints squats deadlifts kind activity
can't maintained these, know, eight say 60
seconds. set lifting weights repeated, repeated, done anywhere
20 minutes, weight training power lifting kinds things kettlebell
swings 60 minutes, switchover point can burn
fat, go fasted comes earlier. makes sense
nothing holy 90 minute point medium intensity Zone 2 cardio. 90
minute point point body shifts mainly burning glycogen,
basically, sugar comes muscles liver realizes going
while, going shift storage site fuel reserve like body fat.
going happen while, going start tapping body fat stores. Now, fat


doesn't little brain there. innervated neurons, doesn't thoughts.
don't actually control switch mind. something
milieu various hormones. happen insulin go far
enough. ate exercise, increase insulin, ate
carbohydrates bigger increase insulin, fat proteins indeed
lower amounts insulin fasting will give lowest amount insulin. Well,
switch point going come earlier exercise. think
something high intensity 20, 30, 40 minutes, maybe lift weights
get Zone 2 cardio. fasted, literature says going
burn body fat per unit time eaten exercise.
mean? means want burn body fat,
protocols approved safely, exercise intensely 20 60
minutes, higher intensity obviously shorter going be,
move Zone 2 cardio. fasted medium intensity cardio
say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage
body fat. need eat like eat train also can work.
train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue
intensely exercise therefore fuel source drawing from. hopefully
made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long
period time shift burning fat. indeed seems going
fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low
carbohydrates higher carbs, that. general, theme simple.
want insulin levels pretty low goal body fat reduction,
want oxidize body fat. fasting cases, fat fasting cases
just ingesting fats. Fat protein, cases people will
eating carbohydrates. not dictate particular nutrition regimen.



01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat
burning overall. look percentage body fat burned,
look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training
followed low intensity training even just followed going back life

breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories

vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps

increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one

almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol

interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.

several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going

science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food

travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit

shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning

also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going

say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage
body fat. need eat like eat train also can work.
train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue

made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long
period time shift burning fat. indeed seems going
fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat
burning overall. look percentage body fat burned,
look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training
followed low intensity training even just followed going back life

breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release

previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately

States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything

case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate

fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps

increase fat mobilization oxidation. Now, make sense shivering one
strongest stimuli one can incorporate stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering
almost always associated cold. think shivering, think cold,
get cold, shiver. two ways shivering can increase fat loss.
several ways can use shivering, can leverage shivering
can leverage cold accelerate fat loss. correctly.
people using cold frankly suggesting cold means increase
metabolism fat loss suggesting exact wrong protocol. fact, one going
recommend 180 degrees opposite direction typical protocol
hear about. talk use cold leverage shiver
particularly strong stimulus increase fat loss mobilization oxidation

cooling, cooling palms specific ways bottoms feet.
interested that, improve performance endurance strength, can
check episode. people using cold exposure typically
taking cold showers getting cold water kind, lake river
cold bath ice bath. probably mixed goals, meaning
like increase metabolism burn fat, well improve mental
resilience. Since today, talking accelerating fat loss use
science-based tools. want emphasize study published nature just
couple years ago, showing exactly cold increases metabolism fat loss.
Okay?

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose
tissue, brown fat brown adipose tissue. third kind
beige adipose tissue. White fat type traditionally think fat,
subcutaneous fat. not particularly rich mitochondria. energy
storage site mobilize fat talked burn
elsewhere. Brown fat largely exists shoulder blades back
neck, scapulae. rich mitochondria called
brown fat. brown fat particular biochemical cascade whereby can take food
energy, can take food, basically, break convert energy within
cells. additional steps involved, unlike fatty acids white fat
travel elsewhere get broken mitochondria convert ATP,
et cetera. Used mitochondria rather. Brown fat thermogenic. can actually use
energy directly. skips step, don't want get diverted going
biochemistry it. Beige fat sort between. white fat brown fat,
mitochondria it, not many brown fat. Now, cold
exposure several things. Making cold can allow us build mental
resilience getting cold kind, doesn't matter cryochamber,
doesn't matter cold day forgot sweater parka. doesn't
matter ice bath lying snow. Cold causes release


adrenaline adrenals. causes release epinephrin
neurons connect fat. Now, big effects cold metabolism fat burning
going two routes. One, expose cold,
opportunity trigger activation brown fat well convert beige fat
true brown fat. essentially create stronger hotter furnace. way
think brown fat. like furnace. principle started
calories versus calories burned. increasing amount
burning, increasing burn energy increasing intensity heat
inside speak. Okay? talking kind metaphorically.

00:50:25 Use Cold Properly Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release
Key/Shiver

Now, can that? Well, get cold water ice bath cold day,
try remain calm resist shivering, actually short circuit
mechanism increasing brown fat thermogenesis. paper published nature
shows shivering causes brown fat increase burning,
burn rate metabolism. works like this, get cold
shiver, shivering low level movement muscle, small movements
triggers release molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
succinate acts brown fat increase brown fat thermogenesis fat burning
overall. actually increases body heat brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
also time can increase amount brown fat converting beige fat
true brown fat. Now, much cold exposure often? key.
give detail set details. Remember resist shiver, not going

maybe five times week, get you... get shower whatever is,
start shiver. Genuinely shiver. minute so, get out,
spend one three minutes out, don't dry off, get back anywhere one
three minutes, try access shiver point again. might three
repetitions that. three times three times total. Okay? great

fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem

Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps

moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find

high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen

period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity

60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

00:47:30 White, Brown & Beige Fat; & Using Cold-Induced Shiver Burn Fat

several kinds fat. Three kinds fact. white fat, white adipose

something high intensity 20, 30, 40 minutes, maybe lift weights
get Zone 2 cardio. fasted, literature says going

mean? means want burn body fat,
protocols approved safely, exercise intensely 20 60
minutes, higher intensity obviously shorter going be,
move Zone 2 cardio. fasted medium intensity cardio
say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage
body fat. need eat like eat train also can work.
train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue

made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long

fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling

makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps

straightforward. interesting studies able find

high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat

without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.
1976, goes way back, glucose reduces fat burning exercise.
studies want look up, easy find

can find number examples eating exercise reduces amount fat

eaten exercise within one three hours prior exercise,
reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,

without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.
1976, goes way back, glucose reduces fat burning exercise.
studies want look up, easy find

eaten exercise within one three hours prior exercise,
reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps

moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately

States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one

using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps

However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy

much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind

fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps

moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release

States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one

using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance

However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.

reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior

say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage

train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue
intensely exercise therefore fuel source drawing from. hopefully
made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long

fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps

moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

caffeine adapted. talked earlier episode want make sure
clear this. not used drinking caffeine suddenly decide
going drink big cup coffee training, will vasoconstrict will limit

interesting phenomenon ingestion caffeine serves performance
enhancer, increasing alertness, also way dilating vasculature

feel drinking 100 200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams caffeine training.
indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps
much training really, really intensely. bottom line is, like


caffeine can use safely, ingesting somewhere 104 milligrams

fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent

fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.

move Zone 2 cardio. fasted medium intensity cardio
say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage

train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue
intensely exercise therefore fuel source drawing from. hopefully
made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long

fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen

post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps
much training really, really intensely. bottom line is, like


caffeine can use safely, ingesting somewhere 104 milligrams

without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.
1976, goes way back, glucose reduces fat burning exercise.

reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior

made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity

fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low

01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,

indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release

States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one

using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate

fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger

can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance

particularly interesting one, different types exercising gauge

vastly different effects things like hormones metabolism depending whether
not high intensity, moderate intensity low intensity. rather think
weight training versus cardiovascular exercise, think simple way,
fluid way conversation exercise fat loss terms three
general types training. Whether not done weights body weight doesn't
really matter. high intensity interval training. Something seems
gained lot popularity recent years. So-called HITT, H-I-I-T. high intensity

01:13:30 Exercising Fasted: Truly Accelerate Fat Loss/Oxidation.

many different forms exercise people intensity
important. ask question think many people wondering about, is,
better? Meaning burn fat exercise fasted? fasted
respect wake morning, fasting night,
just hydrate exercise sometimes people will ingest caffeine,
controversy whether not quote quote breaks fast.
whether not caffeine adapted something another episode. case


fasted. probably not eaten anything anywhere three 24
hours maybe even more. also fasted afternoon.
lunch noon four five 6:00 p.m. it, will burn fat exercise
without eating anything first, without ingesting calories first? people
tried really split hairs this, every way people say, well, can fat fast,
fat protein doesn't lead great increases insulin things,
maybe can almonds still train. indeed insulin will prevent
fat oxidation. want really clear. burning part fat cell, movement
fatty acid mitochondria conversion ATP, insulin inhibits process.
However, shown least short periods training, doesn't really seem
matter whether not eat training don't, goal fat oxidation.
Now, want put asterix near that, exceptions.
several studies done that, kind classic ones these, read
you. basically gave people glucose, sugar, increase blood
sugar training not. kind classic study Al Borg all.
1976, goes way back, glucose reduces fat burning exercise.
studies want look up, easy find
PubMed. put Horowitz 1999, [indistinct] another one people
drink milk glucose it. sweet sugary milk exercise, et cetera.
can find number examples eating exercise reduces amount fat
oxidized exercise. can also find lot studies showing that,
eating exercise prior exercise will not reduce amount fat
oxidized. However, types exercise whether medium intensity high
intensity low intensity map studies. hard target
ideal protocol. look really deep literature, start find meta
analysis

01:16:30 90 Minute Rule: 90 Minutes, Fasted Exercisers Start Burn
Fat

people actually aggregated findings modern studies
points specific useful protocols. rule
protocol extracted literature. period 90 minutes moderate
intensity exercise, want clear, 90 minutes moderate intensity


exercise. switchover point whereby ate exercise, will
reduce, excuse me, will burn far less fat 90 minute point onward
gone training fasted. let repeat that. moderate
intensity, so-called zone two cardio type exercise, 90 minute point, happen
eaten exercise within one three hours prior exercise,
reduce amount fat will burn 90 minutes onward, whereas
fasted prior exercise, hadn't eaten anything three hours prior
exercise. 90 minute point, 90 minutes exercise will start burn
fat eaten. Now, 90 minutes moderate intensity exercises
lot. pretty long run. Even running pretty slow pace like 10 12
minute mile, lot running, lot swimming. lot walking,
lot hiking. However, people going hiking day
running day walking day. want burn fat per unit time,

01:18:15 High-Intensity Training Done First, Benefits Fasting Arrive
90min.

want oxidize fat fasted. Now, also studies
pointed fact don't wait 90 minutes order get
enhanced fat burning effect. studies able find looked like
quality peer-reviewed studies no company bias no product bias kind.
studies largely funded federal government university
context pointed fact one high-intensity training, even high
intensity forms training like sprints squats deadlifts kind activity
can't maintained these, know, eight say 60
seconds. set lifting weights repeated, repeated, done anywhere
20 minutes, weight training power lifting kinds things kettlebell
swings 60 minutes, switchover point can burn
fat, go fasted comes earlier. makes sense
nothing holy 90 minute point medium intensity Zone 2 cardio. 90
minute point point body shifts mainly burning glycogen,
basically, sugar comes muscles liver realizes going
while, going shift storage site fuel reserve like body fat.
going happen while, going start tapping body fat stores. Now, fat


doesn't little brain there. innervated neurons, doesn't thoughts.
don't actually control switch mind. something
milieu various hormones. happen insulin go far
enough. ate exercise, increase insulin, ate
carbohydrates bigger increase insulin, fat proteins indeed
lower amounts insulin fasting will give lowest amount insulin. Well,
switch point going come earlier exercise. think
something high intensity 20, 30, 40 minutes, maybe lift weights
get Zone 2 cardio. fasted, literature says going
burn body fat per unit time eaten exercise.
mean? means want burn body fat,
protocols approved safely, exercise intensely 20 60
minutes, higher intensity obviously shorter going be,
move Zone 2 cardio. fasted medium intensity cardio
say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage
body fat. need eat like eat train also can work.
train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue
intensely exercise therefore fuel source drawing from. hopefully
made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long
period time shift burning fat. indeed seems going
fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low
carbohydrates higher carbs, that. general, theme simple.
want insulin levels pretty low goal body fat reduction,
want oxidize body fat. fasting cases, fat fasting cases
just ingesting fats. Fat protein, cases people will
eating carbohydrates. not dictate particular nutrition regimen.



01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat
burning overall. look percentage body fat burned,
look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training
followed low intensity training even just followed going back life

01:26:05 Protocol Exercise-Induced Fat Loss; Adrenalin Effector

going best way continue burn body fat ways
increases basal metabolic rate. distilled simple protocol whereby
three four times week high intensity training followed either nothing
followed low intensity training especially able fasted.
just mention none stuff fasted performance. want
perform really well, reasons performance want to, know,
sport competition, not body fat purposes. Well, kind falls
away modified ideal eat performance. talking
today optimize body fat loss. train moderately high intensity
moderate low intensity, train moderate high intensity, go
life. fact, friend uses strategy. likes train intensely
not often protocol cause busy person. train 20 30 minutes
intensely weights just body weight movement lot, burpees
push-ups sit-ups pull-ups just kind moving kind circuit type
training. breathing really hard, goal always says is, want
breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement
kind, whether not low level shiver, whether not lifting barbell sprinting
hill long bike ride.

01:28:50 Supplements/Compounds Fat Loss Part: Caffeine Fidgeting, & Caffeine

Adrenaline effector fat loss. trigger end, effector. now want
turn attention compounds increase epinephrin adrenaline, well
compounds work outside adrenaline epinephrin pathway increase rates
fat loss. almost always save compounds supplements things sort
end, believe people look first towards behavioral tools
understanding science look toward supplement particular thing
can extract diet. mainly try shift people away kind
magic pill phenomenon idea magic pill really isn't.
frankly, never will be. compounds can greatly
increase fat oxidation mobilization. understanding compounds increase
oxidation mobilization can useful goal accelerate fat loss.
things people can ingest will allow oxidize fat. occurs
mainly increasing amount epinephrin released neurons
innovate fat tissue. One common ones one may already using
caffeine. well-established caffeine can enhance performance,
caffeine adapted. talked earlier episode want make sure
clear this. not used drinking caffeine suddenly decide
going drink big cup coffee training, will vasoconstrict will limit
performance. performance. caffeine adapted however, kind
interesting phenomenon ingestion caffeine serves performance
enhancer, increasing alertness, also way dilating vasculature
allowing blood flow. Now, caffeine burning fat oxidizing mobilizing
fat interesting one. can effective dosages 400 milligrams.
careful caffeine sensitive. people just littlest bit


caffeine mind goes crazy, uncomfortable. can
cardiovascular effects people hypertension, et cetera. please check
doctor. 400 milligrams roughly cup half coffee two cups

get medium-sized close gram caffeine,
why, regular caffeine consumer don't get gram caffeine
coffee day, will get headache. can cause constriction dilation blood
vessels ways complicated, get headache. people like way
feel drinking 100 200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams caffeine training.
indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps
much training really, really intensely. bottom line is, like


caffeine can use safely, ingesting somewhere 104 milligrams
caffeine prior exercise somewhere 30 40 minutes exercise can
beneficial talking fat oxidation burning body fat. caffeine.

breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying

kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high

neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,

things people can ingest will allow oxidize fat. occurs
mainly increasing amount epinephrin released neurons
innovate fat tissue. One common ones one may already using
caffeine. well-established caffeine can enhance performance,
caffeine adapted. talked earlier episode want make sure
clear this. not used drinking caffeine suddenly decide
going drink big cup coffee training, will vasoconstrict will limit
performance. performance. caffeine adapted however, kind
interesting phenomenon ingestion caffeine serves performance
enhancer, increasing alertness, also way dilating vasculature
allowing blood flow. Now, caffeine burning fat oxidizing mobilizing
fat interesting one. can effective dosages 400 milligrams.

feel drinking 100 200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams caffeine training.
indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps
much training really, really intensely. bottom line is, like


caffeine can use safely, ingesting somewhere 104 milligrams
caffeine prior exercise somewhere 30 40 minutes exercise can
beneficial talking fat oxidation burning body fat. caffeine.

study showing heart rate slightly reduced kind nice if,
drink much caffeine heart rate goes up, maybe increase fidgeting
fat burning, don't like feeling basal heart rate
high. like heart rate elevate exercise, not just kind resting
working throughout day. reason don't understand
effect mate increasing fat oxidation reducing heart rate just slightly.
interesting. probably lends [indistinct] explains subjective experience
mate kind little nice even mellow stimulant. not really
supercharged stimulant like caffeine coffee sources.

01:44:35 Acetly-L-Carnitine: Facilitates Fat Oxidation

Although drink much mate will also make jittery. one
compound think discuss terms increasing fat loss,


carnitine acetyl-L-carnitine, lie pathway. can return basic
knowledge now fat mobilization oxidation. fat mobilized makes
cells needs oxidized. literally burning fat conversion
energy accomplished facilitated presence glucagon
elevated, GLP increases process insulin low. talked
ways manage insulin episode previous episode. L-carnitine
acetyl-L-carnitine particular facilitates fat oxidation. helps convert fatty acids
ATP. indeed supplementing L-carnitine can increase fat loss. shown.
dosages? Well, people ingest anywhere 500 milligrams two grams per day
divided doses typically. people really extreme taking injectable L-
carnitine, certainly not tried that. confess used pill form time time
part, fat oxidation effects, also effects
tends have. exploring effects acetyl-L-carnitine has, huge
variety effects cellar metabolism. can reduce ammonia blood
actually quite strong effect. can reduce things like C-reactive protein,
want C-reactive protein levels managed. not want high. Can
slightly reduce blood glucose. can slightly increase HDLC, good form blood
lipid slightly reduce overall cholesterol. mentioned, can slightly modify
pathway involving glucagon, get considerable effect, not huge effect
fat oxidation, can improve pat oxidation rates. number effects,
talked month hormones sort thing. strong
effects rates pregnancy sperm quality. clearly carnitine lots
different things lots different cells. impacting sperm motility. large
number studies supporting that. Slight reductions blood pressure
interesting effects reducing fatigue exercise, reducing inflammatory markers
like interleukin 6. number effects whole quote unquote
positive least direction things may want. emphasize
may. certainly don't need acetyl-L-carnitine order lose fat, now
understand cellular process fat mobilized oxidized, make
sense L-carnitine important converting fatty acids energy,
supplementing L-carnitine make sense. Acetyl-L-carnitine type L-carnitine
form L-carnitine say, transported utilized easily body.

doesn't little brain there. innervated neurons, doesn't thoughts.
don't actually control switch mind. something
milieu various hormones. happen insulin go far
enough. ate exercise, increase insulin, ate
carbohydrates bigger increase insulin, fat proteins indeed
lower amounts insulin fasting will give lowest amount insulin. Well,
switch point going come earlier exercise. think
something high intensity 20, 30, 40 minutes, maybe lift weights
get Zone 2 cardio. fasted, literature says going
burn body fat per unit time eaten exercise.
mean? means want burn body fat,
protocols approved safely, exercise intensely 20 60
minutes, higher intensity obviously shorter going be,
move Zone 2 cardio. fasted medium intensity cardio
say. fasted, indeed will burn higher percentage
body fat. need eat like eat train also can work.
train intensely, likely shift fat burning pattern quickly
well. again, isn't really issue long exercise. issue
intensely exercise therefore fuel source drawing from. hopefully
made clear, basically need deplete glycogen high intensity
exercise move steady state exercise will allow burn fat.
need perform medium intensity low intensity type exercise long
period time shift burning fat. indeed seems going
fasted will facilitate burning fat overall. can't even get
exercise, somebody just can't training all, unwilling
incapable training, unless eat something, obviously eating something
makes sense. eat prior exercise, whole biz
people argue fight whether not go low
carbohydrates higher carbs, that. general, theme simple.
want insulin levels pretty low goal body fat reduction,
want oxidize body fat. fasting cases, fat fasting cases
just ingesting fats. Fat protein, cases people will
eating carbohydrates. not dictate particular nutrition regimen.



01:22:44 Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: Bias Toward Fat Oxidation

just hormone balance things fat oxidation works. Now, one
thing interesting cannot overlooked issue much energy
burn activity. probably already know
this, whole business calories versus calories out, people counting
number calories burn aerobic session whatever
session one half equation really eclipses important issue,
much increase metabolism given exercise create
exercise? talk hours this, simple way view that,
high intensity training, anaerobic training weight training, sprints, burpees, kind
thing. don't know days hear not supposed burpees people
think burpees dangerous. not suggesting particular movements here.
decide right you. burpees. don't seem injured them,
hear terrible people. anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever
happens anaerobic exercise higher intensity sprints taps
glycogen stores movement burn energy per unit time
moderate intensity. High intensity burns modern intensity.
straightforward. interesting studies able find
happens type exercise showed percentage fat burn
high intensity exercise actually greater. words, burn lot glycogen
high intensity exercise. exercise, post exercise oxygen
consumption sometimes called goes up. know train intensely
post exercise oxygen consumption goes sometimes 24 hours.
period time oxidize fat not glycogen. Now, interesting
reverse also true, people long bouts low moderate intensity
exercise. typically things like running, swimming, biking, et cetera.
60, 90 minutes, two hours maybe even people training marathons half
marathons, stop training, burn glycogen, carbohydrate, even
though burning body fat per unit time low intensity exercise.
kind inversion. High-intensity burns glycogen activity,
body fat afterwards. Moderate low intensity burns percentage-wise
body fat oxidized glycogen actual exercise afterward
glycogen. don't want get complicated. point pick


exercise like, going regularly, seem high
intensity exercise followed moderate intensity exercise going optimal fat
burning overall. look percentage body fat burned,
look overall increase basal metabolic rate, moderate high intensity training
followed low intensity training even just followed going back life

01:26:05 Protocol Exercise-Induced Fat Loss; Adrenalin Effector

going best way continue burn body fat ways
increases basal metabolic rate. distilled simple protocol whereby
three four times week high intensity training followed either nothing
followed low intensity training especially able fasted.
just mention none stuff fasted performance. want
perform really well, reasons performance want to, know,
sport competition, not body fat purposes. Well, kind falls
away modified ideal eat performance. talking
today optimize body fat loss. train moderately high intensity
moderate low intensity, train moderate high intensity, go
life. fact, friend uses strategy. likes train intensely
not often protocol cause busy person. train 20 30 minutes
intensely weights just body weight movement lot, burpees
push-ups sit-ups pull-ups just kind moving kind circuit type
training. breathing really hard, goal always says is, want
breathe hard 30 minutes every day. afterwards hydrates drinks
coffee moves day. walking around taking calls carrying
around children kinds things keep really busy
kind like low intensity work. think get principle now.
asking scientists yourselves. certain patterns
exercise lead less fat loss? mean, can't just energy
burn. already established that. again, neurons.
engage nervous system. non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, fidgeting cold can induce thermogenesis engaging
shiver tight movement low-level movements. Big movements high
intensity, meaning require lot effort, deploy lot adrenaline epinephrin


neurons signal particular types amounts fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
whereas low level intensity exercise, low moderate intensity exercise, walking,
running, biking can easily, not much adrenaline release.
adrenaline aka epinephrin really final common path movement
kind, whether not low level shiver, whether not lifting barbell sprinting
hill long bike ride.

01:28:50 Supplements/Compounds Fat Loss Part: Caffeine Fidgeting, & Caffeine
Adaptation

Adrenaline effector fat loss. trigger end, effector. now want
turn attention compounds increase epinephrin adrenaline, well
compounds work outside adrenaline epinephrin pathway increase rates
fat loss. almost always save compounds supplements things sort
end, believe people look first towards behavioral tools
understanding science look toward supplement particular thing
can extract diet. mainly try shift people away kind
magic pill phenomenon idea magic pill really isn't.
frankly, never will be. compounds can greatly
increase fat oxidation mobilization. understanding compounds increase
oxidation mobilization can useful goal accelerate fat loss.
things people can ingest will allow oxidize fat. occurs
mainly increasing amount epinephrin released neurons
innovate fat tissue. One common ones one may already using
caffeine. well-established caffeine can enhance performance,
caffeine adapted. talked earlier episode want make sure
clear this. not used drinking caffeine suddenly decide
going drink big cup coffee training, will vasoconstrict will limit
performance. performance. caffeine adapted however, kind
interesting phenomenon ingestion caffeine serves performance
enhancer, increasing alertness, also way dilating vasculature
allowing blood flow. Now, caffeine burning fat oxidizing mobilizing
fat interesting one. can effective dosages 400 milligrams.
careful caffeine sensitive. people just littlest bit


caffeine mind goes crazy, uncomfortable. can
cardiovascular effects people hypertension, et cetera. please check
doctor. 400 milligrams roughly cup half coffee two cups
coffee. Nowadays, lot caffeine coffee. go typical cafe
get medium-sized close gram caffeine,
why, regular caffeine consumer don't get gram caffeine
coffee day, will get headache. can cause constriction dilation blood
vessels ways complicated, get headache. people like way
feel drinking 100 200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams caffeine training.
indeed will lead increase fat oxidation. will will release
epinephrin adrenaline. just place context said
previously. say normally Zone 2 cardio, going moderately
intense run 30 60 minutes so. think current recommendation guidelines
States people engage 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise five days
week 150 minutes. goal improve maintain health
cardiovascular system. 80% people United States fail that, anything
close it. way threshold government recommended.
case, government recommendations, think pretty good. one
always better course. 80% people aren't even that. However, just
using logic understanding epinephrin adrenaline affecting fat
oxidation process. go 15 minutes drank caffeine
went, yes, probably oxidize fat per unit time. Can compensate
exercise not just drinking caffeine? Well, probably just talking
fat loss, caffeine makes fidget lot, right? amount calories
burn 30 minute run, unless run intense wearing weight
vest hill, not great, right? probably get somewhere
400, 500 calories burned area. said earlier, lot data now
support fidgeting day can burn anywhere 800 2,500 calories day.
might say, well, fidgeting better running, ah, doesn't trigger
activation positive health effects cardiovascular system. fidgeting alone
can great, need exercise reasons. Caffeine can enhance
amount fat burn duration exercise. can shift percentage
fat oxidize compared glycogen. Unless take caffeine ramps
much training really, really intensely. bottom line is, like


caffeine can use safely, ingesting somewhere 104 milligrams
caffeine prior exercise somewhere 30 40 minutes exercise can
beneficial talking fat oxidation burning body fat. caffeine.

useful interesting? Well, terms tools actionable
reasonable safety margins, talked something called GLP-1.
something can triggered ingestion yerba mate, tea,
guess half Argentine, grew drinking mate. think drinking mate

increases GLP-1. short takeaway mate increases GLP-1 yes,
increases percentage fat will burn. increases fat burning.
especially true, turns scientific literature, ingest mate prior
exercise kind. want burn fat drinking mate exercise
good. Drinking rest not exercising will also help shift metabolism
toward enhanced burning fat increasing fat oxidation. Now, whole
category pharmaceuticals developed right now late stage trials

seems. Semaglutide way pronounce it. S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.
Semaglutide not way pronounce it. Semaglutide way
described internet. case, compound increases GLP-1.
actually GLP-1 analog cases, go various types trade names.
GLP-1 pathway interesting. people, including myself, not interested
taking prescription drug increase GLP-1, ingestion mate. just
get mate leaves, pour water drink it. kind interesting, not
often discussed can increase amount GLP-1 by, can essentially
reuse tea. first time drink can very, intense. fact,
people find mate almost tastes like burnt leaves. intense. don't want
water hot. learned trick friend. can reuse leaves
again, probably day go bad. that, start
extract compounds mate leaf increased GLP-1.
kind cool. can kind get increased effect. typically make
16 30 ounces just sip throughout day, like train.
people don't like mate might prefer something like guayusa, spelled
G-U-A-Y-U-S-A. G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa Ecuador, despite USA
ending it. Ecuador. sweeter tasting tea. doesn't
