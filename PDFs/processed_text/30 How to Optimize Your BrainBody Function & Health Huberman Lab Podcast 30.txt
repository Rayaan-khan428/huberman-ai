00:08:22 Main Drivers Feelings & Performance

certainly enjoy meditation know beneficial us.
somebody cares immediate long-term health,
somebody interested performance kind work relationships, et cetera,
today's topic believe among important ones you. topics
cover, thing call sense self, also called interoception perhaps
foundational level importance that. feel
capable doing. fact will go far say interoception ability
sense inner real estate right next sleep. perhaps one feature
health bodily function primary early determine good feel
now short term, longterm, sets stage everything
capable doing. don't take care thing call interoception, just


like don't take care sleep, cannot perform well will not remain healthy.
Interoception sense self essentially thing, will use terms
interchangeably, least sake today's discussion. promise can
learn little bit mechanisms self sensing, understanding going
internal milieu, say internal environment, will position
simple things can lead outsize positive effects everything
sleep body composition, mental focus, mood, ability regulate stress,
indeed even ability heal recovery injuries different kinds, brain injury
bodily injury. sense self absolutely crucial. sometimes called sixth
sense, right alongside five senses like hearing vision, touch, taste, smell, et
cetera, sense self different. Sense self really going
internally within confines skin. involves two key features can
understand features, understand modulates changes, ability
sense features, lot things can terms
structure nutritional practices, relate exercise practices, perhaps
even certain things take terms supplementation can basically make
feel better, alert, capable everything. don't think
hyperbolic statement, I, fact, know not hyperbolic statement
system body connects brain bodily organs connects
bodily organs brain. communication brain body
directions creates situation either positioned things well,
positioned things poorly. really want dive dissect,
system brain, body communication? look like? actual
neurons connections? that, promise going place protocols,
tools can apply order make sure neurons connections
working optimally. begin talking system communicates

00:11:45 Brain-Body: Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue

brain body body back brain. system often
associated 10th cranial nerve called vagus nerve. word vagus
relates word vagabond, wander, indeed vagus nerve vast,
enormous wandering set nerves, not one nerve. not like one fiber, one axon.
say nervous system, wires, call axons let neurons


communicate. bunch neurons bunch wires go everywhere,
go? Well leave brain, brain stem, brain stem kind
back brain. touch back neck, three inches deep
touching. neurons send information body
control bodily organs, fast heart is, beating fast breathing,
fast digestion occurring. Even things like whether not going secrete
so-called killer cells, immune cells spleen go ward off bacteria. Now
neurons don't know unless receive information
going within body within body, heart, lungs, diaphragm,
gut, everything intestines stomach, et cetera, spleen
sending information also brain. mentioned before, two-way
street. vagus nerve important nerve, just saying vagus nerve,
sounds like singular. sounds like one thing, actually talking
series super highways, like Google maps, got stuff going everywhere
alternate routes, communicating back forth. two fundamental features
going body need communicated brain, neurons
brain stem order brain body work together correctly.
two types information mechanical information. things like pressure, things
like lack pressure chemical information, whether not gut acidic
whether not not acidic, whether not sort pathogen, know,
something ate got body somehow making sick
whether not don't pathogen body. got mechanical
sensing chemical sensing. think sense self
ability understand going body, feel good, feel bad,
sense self dependent mechanical phenomenon chemical
phenomenon. every organ body, whether not heart
lungs spleen, mechanical information organ instance,
gut full empty, whether not heart beating fast beating slowly,
mechanical, chemical information, whether not gut feels nice, whether,
know, say nice, mean, whether not balance acidity
alkalinity, feels right whether not gut feels off, doesn't feel quite
right. chemical information. not getting enough oxygen levels
carbon dioxide gas go high. lungs can register
chemical information sent brain. brain certain things


actually really encourages certain things order adjust chemistry.
first principle everyone understand sense self
sensing mechanical chemical information every organ body,
except one, brain. brain actually doesn't pain receptors.
doesn't even touch receptors. brain command center. helps drive
govern changes organs body. brain doesn't move, least not
much. can move little bit fluid moves within it. long healthy, not
moving much. brain no sensation own, fact, brain
surgery people, will size put anesthesia scalp. cut
away skin people don't feel anything. use anesthesia
peel back skin use a, call is, bone saw.
basically saw open little window skull. actually done
seen before. done many times before, inside brain,
can put electrodes can put various things there, course,
therapeutic purposes. without anesthesia actual brain tissue,
no receptors sense anything. doesn't pain receptors. doesn't
pressure receptors. None that, headache head, feels
like much pressure, well lie outside brain.
organs different. need tell brain going on.
ways can control mechanical chemical state organs ways
powerful, crucial do, can properly regulate
mechanical chemical environment body, brain functions better.
absolutely clear data gut healthy, get alkalinity right,
acidity, right, spleen healthy happy, lungs working
properly, not just breathing pumping air, breathing right
cadence particular activity, brain will function better. talk
can adjust mechanical chemical environment organs order
make brain better brain can make mechanical chemical
environment within organs function better. instance going talk
can change chemistry gut order brain able focus
better, think better, remember better sleep better. going talk
can change chemistry organs body, immune
system will function better otherwise. can actually heal faster
small cuts



00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue

bruises, also injuries kind, even major injuries. mentioned before,
got organs, heart, lungs, diaphragm, explain is,
gut spleen. spleen immune organ. take one example
explain mechanical chemical information particular set
organs communicates brain changes brain works.
organ like focus first lungs diaphragm. familiar
lungs, two big bags air, actually not two big bags air.
actually little tiny sacs within them, actually millions little sacs called alveoli
lungs. alveoli lungs like little tiny balloons throughout lungs,
balloons, have, air can actually contain.
not big bags air there, lungs, actually millions millions
little tiny bags air within lungs. little bags air can fill can
deflate, right, just like lungs overall can fill can deflate. diaphragm
muscle, kind shaped like dome. kind a, know, think
basketball soccer ball air pushed it. kind
crescent shape dome shaped, sits lungs way diaphragm
lungs work together interesting. diaphragm actually skeletal
muscles. just like bicep quadricep. fact skeletal muscle
important unique property, can control voluntarily.
can decide take control diaphragm just consciously deciding want
breathe particular way, just like can take conscious control legs.
will work just fine, not thinking them, walk provide,
already know walk, moment, can decide change rate
walking, so-called cadence walking. diaphragm skeletal muscle also
property, diaphragm moves down, depending breathe,
rather, say diaphragm moves determines
breathe. breathe also dependent little muscles ribs,
intercostals muscles, martial arts fan Bruce Lee
famous pronounced intercostals sorts of, know,
bridging exercise, et cetera. muscles. them, even
us, us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. breathe


couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today

hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.

think will enjoy it.

00:08:22 Main Drivers Feelings & Performance

certainly enjoy meditation know beneficial us.
somebody cares immediate long-term health,
somebody interested performance kind work relationships, et cetera,
today's topic believe among important ones you. topics
cover, thing call sense self, also called interoception perhaps
foundational level importance that. feel
capable doing. fact will go far say interoception ability
sense inner real estate right next sleep. perhaps one feature
health bodily function primary early determine good feel
now short term, longterm, sets stage everything
capable doing. don't take care thing call interoception, just


like don't take care sleep, cannot perform well will not remain healthy.
Interoception sense self essentially thing, will use terms
interchangeably, least sake today's discussion. promise can
learn little bit mechanisms self sensing, understanding going
internal milieu, say internal environment, will position
simple things can lead outsize positive effects everything
sleep body composition, mental focus, mood, ability regulate stress,
indeed even ability heal recovery injuries different kinds, brain injury
bodily injury. sense self absolutely crucial. sometimes called sixth
sense, right alongside five senses like hearing vision, touch, taste, smell, et
cetera, sense self different. Sense self really going
internally within confines skin. involves two key features can
understand features, understand modulates changes, ability
sense features, lot things can terms
structure nutritional practices, relate exercise practices, perhaps
even certain things take terms supplementation can basically make
feel better, alert, capable everything. don't think
hyperbolic statement, I, fact, know not hyperbolic statement
system body connects brain bodily organs connects
bodily organs brain. communication brain body
directions creates situation either positioned things well,
positioned things poorly. really want dive dissect,
system brain, body communication? look like? actual
neurons connections? that, promise going place protocols,
tools can apply order make sure neurons connections
working optimally. begin talking system communicates

00:11:45 Brain-Body: Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue

brain body body back brain. system often
associated 10th cranial nerve called vagus nerve. word vagus
relates word vagabond, wander, indeed vagus nerve vast,
enormous wandering set nerves, not one nerve. not like one fiber, one axon.
say nervous system, wires, call axons let neurons


communicate. bunch neurons bunch wires go everywhere,
go? Well leave brain, brain stem, brain stem kind
back brain. touch back neck, three inches deep
touching. neurons send information body
control bodily organs, fast heart is, beating fast breathing,
fast digestion occurring. Even things like whether not going secrete
so-called killer cells, immune cells spleen go ward off bacteria. Now
neurons don't know unless receive information
going within body within body, heart, lungs, diaphragm,
gut, everything intestines stomach, et cetera, spleen
sending information also brain. mentioned before, two-way
street. vagus nerve important nerve, just saying vagus nerve,
sounds like singular. sounds like one thing, actually talking
series super highways, like Google maps, got stuff going everywhere
alternate routes, communicating back forth. two fundamental features
going body need communicated brain, neurons
brain stem order brain body work together correctly.
two types information mechanical information. things like pressure, things
like lack pressure chemical information, whether not gut acidic
whether not not acidic, whether not sort pathogen, know,
something ate got body somehow making sick
whether not don't pathogen body. got mechanical
sensing chemical sensing. think sense self
ability understand going body, feel good, feel bad,
sense self dependent mechanical phenomenon chemical
phenomenon. every organ body, whether not heart
lungs spleen, mechanical information organ instance,
gut full empty, whether not heart beating fast beating slowly,
mechanical, chemical information, whether not gut feels nice, whether,
know, say nice, mean, whether not balance acidity
alkalinity, feels right whether not gut feels off, doesn't feel quite
right. chemical information. not getting enough oxygen levels
carbon dioxide gas go high. lungs can register
chemical information sent brain. brain certain things


actually really encourages certain things order adjust chemistry.
first principle everyone understand sense self
sensing mechanical chemical information every organ body,
except one, brain. brain actually doesn't pain receptors.
doesn't even touch receptors. brain command center. helps drive
govern changes organs body. brain doesn't move, least not
much. can move little bit fluid moves within it. long healthy, not
moving much. brain no sensation own, fact, brain
surgery people, will size put anesthesia scalp. cut
away skin people don't feel anything. use anesthesia
peel back skin use a, call is, bone saw.
basically saw open little window skull. actually done
seen before. done many times before, inside brain,
can put electrodes can put various things there, course,
therapeutic purposes. without anesthesia actual brain tissue,
no receptors sense anything. doesn't pain receptors. doesn't
pressure receptors. None that, headache head, feels
like much pressure, well lie outside brain.
organs different. need tell brain going on.
ways can control mechanical chemical state organs ways
powerful, crucial do, can properly regulate
mechanical chemical environment body, brain functions better.
absolutely clear data gut healthy, get alkalinity right,
acidity, right, spleen healthy happy, lungs working
properly, not just breathing pumping air, breathing right
cadence particular activity, brain will function better. talk
can adjust mechanical chemical environment organs order
make brain better brain can make mechanical chemical
environment within organs function better. instance going talk
can change chemistry gut order brain able focus
better, think better, remember better sleep better. going talk
can change chemistry organs body, immune
system will function better otherwise. can actually heal faster
small cuts



00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue

bruises, also injuries kind, even major injuries. mentioned before,
got organs, heart, lungs, diaphragm, explain is,
gut spleen. spleen immune organ. take one example
explain mechanical chemical information particular set
organs communicates brain changes brain works.
organ like focus first lungs diaphragm. familiar
lungs, two big bags air, actually not two big bags air.
actually little tiny sacs within them, actually millions little sacs called alveoli
lungs. alveoli lungs like little tiny balloons throughout lungs,
balloons, have, air can actually contain.
not big bags air there, lungs, actually millions millions
little tiny bags air within lungs. little bags air can fill can
deflate, right, just like lungs overall can fill can deflate. diaphragm
muscle, kind shaped like dome. kind a, know, think
basketball soccer ball air pushed it. kind
crescent shape dome shaped, sits lungs way diaphragm
lungs work together interesting. diaphragm actually skeletal
muscles. just like bicep quadricep. fact skeletal muscle
important unique property, can control voluntarily.
can decide take control diaphragm just consciously deciding want
breathe particular way, just like can take conscious control legs.
will work just fine, not thinking them, walk provide,
already know walk, moment, can decide change rate
walking, so-called cadence walking. diaphragm skeletal muscle also
property, diaphragm moves down, depending breathe,
rather, say diaphragm moves determines
breathe. breathe also dependent little muscles ribs,
intercostals muscles, martial arts fan Bruce Lee
famous pronounced intercostals sorts of, know,
bridging exercise, et cetera. muscles. them, even
us, us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. breathe


couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods

experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no

nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked

00:11:45 Brain-Body: Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue

brain body body back brain. system often
associated 10th cranial nerve called vagus nerve. word vagus
relates word vagabond, wander, indeed vagus nerve vast,
enormous wandering set nerves, not one nerve. not like one fiber, one axon.
say nervous system, wires, call axons let neurons


communicate. bunch neurons bunch wires go everywhere,
go? Well leave brain, brain stem, brain stem kind
back brain. touch back neck, three inches deep
touching. neurons send information body
control bodily organs, fast heart is, beating fast breathing,
fast digestion occurring. Even things like whether not going secrete
so-called killer cells, immune cells spleen go ward off bacteria. Now
neurons don't know unless receive information
going within body within body, heart, lungs, diaphragm,
gut, everything intestines stomach, et cetera, spleen
sending information also brain. mentioned before, two-way
street. vagus nerve important nerve, just saying vagus nerve,
sounds like singular. sounds like one thing, actually talking
series super highways, like Google maps, got stuff going everywhere
alternate routes, communicating back forth. two fundamental features
going body need communicated brain, neurons
brain stem order brain body work together correctly.
two types information mechanical information. things like pressure, things
like lack pressure chemical information, whether not gut acidic
whether not not acidic, whether not sort pathogen, know,
something ate got body somehow making sick
whether not don't pathogen body. got mechanical
sensing chemical sensing. think sense self
ability understand going body, feel good, feel bad,
sense self dependent mechanical phenomenon chemical
phenomenon. every organ body, whether not heart
lungs spleen, mechanical information organ instance,
gut full empty, whether not heart beating fast beating slowly,
mechanical, chemical information, whether not gut feels nice, whether,
know, say nice, mean, whether not balance acidity
alkalinity, feels right whether not gut feels off, doesn't feel quite
right. chemical information. not getting enough oxygen levels
carbon dioxide gas go high. lungs can register
chemical information sent brain. brain certain things


actually really encourages certain things order adjust chemistry.
first principle everyone understand sense self
sensing mechanical chemical information every organ body,
except one, brain. brain actually doesn't pain receptors.
doesn't even touch receptors. brain command center. helps drive
govern changes organs body. brain doesn't move, least not
much. can move little bit fluid moves within it. long healthy, not
moving much. brain no sensation own, fact, brain
surgery people, will size put anesthesia scalp. cut
away skin people don't feel anything. use anesthesia
peel back skin use a, call is, bone saw.
basically saw open little window skull. actually done
seen before. done many times before, inside brain,
can put electrodes can put various things there, course,
therapeutic purposes. without anesthesia actual brain tissue,
no receptors sense anything. doesn't pain receptors. doesn't
pressure receptors. None that, headache head, feels
like much pressure, well lie outside brain.
organs different. need tell brain going on.
ways can control mechanical chemical state organs ways
powerful, crucial do, can properly regulate
mechanical chemical environment body, brain functions better.
absolutely clear data gut healthy, get alkalinity right,
acidity, right, spleen healthy happy, lungs working
properly, not just breathing pumping air, breathing right
cadence particular activity, brain will function better. talk
can adjust mechanical chemical environment organs order
make brain better brain can make mechanical chemical
environment within organs function better. instance going talk
can change chemistry gut order brain able focus
better, think better, remember better sleep better. going talk
can change chemistry organs body, immune
system will function better otherwise. can actually heal faster
small cuts



00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue

bruises, also injuries kind, even major injuries. mentioned before,
got organs, heart, lungs, diaphragm, explain is,
gut spleen. spleen immune organ. take one example
explain mechanical chemical information particular set
organs communicates brain changes brain works.
organ like focus first lungs diaphragm. familiar
lungs, two big bags air, actually not two big bags air.
actually little tiny sacs within them, actually millions little sacs called alveoli
lungs. alveoli lungs like little tiny balloons throughout lungs,
balloons, have, air can actually contain.
not big bags air there, lungs, actually millions millions
little tiny bags air within lungs. little bags air can fill can
deflate, right, just like lungs overall can fill can deflate. diaphragm
muscle, kind shaped like dome. kind a, know, think
basketball soccer ball air pushed it. kind
crescent shape dome shaped, sits lungs way diaphragm
lungs work together interesting. diaphragm actually skeletal
muscles. just like bicep quadricep. fact skeletal muscle
important unique property, can control voluntarily.
can decide take control diaphragm just consciously deciding want
breathe particular way, just like can take conscious control legs.
will work just fine, not thinking them, walk provide,
already know walk, moment, can decide change rate
walking, so-called cadence walking. diaphragm skeletal muscle also
property, diaphragm moves down, depending breathe,
rather, say diaphragm moves determines
breathe. breathe also dependent little muscles ribs,
intercostals muscles, martial arts fan Bruce Lee
famous pronounced intercostals sorts of, know,
bridging exercise, et cetera. muscles. them, even
us, us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. breathe


couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious

subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,

seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap

ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window

organs different. need tell brain going on.
ways can control mechanical chemical state organs ways
powerful, crucial do, can properly regulate
mechanical chemical environment body, brain functions better.
absolutely clear data gut healthy, get alkalinity right,
acidity, right, spleen healthy happy, lungs working
properly, not just breathing pumping air, breathing right
cadence particular activity, brain will function better. talk
can adjust mechanical chemical environment organs order
make brain better brain can make mechanical chemical
environment within organs function better. instance going talk
can change chemistry gut order brain able focus
better, think better, remember better sleep better. going talk
can change chemistry organs body, immune
system will function better otherwise. can actually heal faster
small cuts



00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue

bruises, also injuries kind, even major injuries. mentioned before,
got organs, heart, lungs, diaphragm, explain is,
gut spleen. spleen immune organ. take one example
explain mechanical chemical information particular set
organs communicates brain changes brain works.
organ like focus first lungs diaphragm. familiar
lungs, two big bags air, actually not two big bags air.
actually little tiny sacs within them, actually millions little sacs called alveoli
lungs. alveoli lungs like little tiny balloons throughout lungs,
balloons, have, air can actually contain.
not big bags air there, lungs, actually millions millions
little tiny bags air within lungs. little bags air can fill can
deflate, right, just like lungs overall can fill can deflate. diaphragm
muscle, kind shaped like dome. kind a, know, think
basketball soccer ball air pushed it. kind
crescent shape dome shaped, sits lungs way diaphragm
lungs work together interesting. diaphragm actually skeletal
muscles. just like bicep quadricep. fact skeletal muscle
important unique property, can control voluntarily.
can decide take control diaphragm just consciously deciding want
breathe particular way, just like can take conscious control legs.
will work just fine, not thinking them, walk provide,
already know walk, moment, can decide change rate
walking, so-called cadence walking. diaphragm skeletal muscle also
property, diaphragm moves down, depending breathe,
rather, say diaphragm moves determines
breathe. breathe also dependent little muscles ribs,
intercostals muscles, martial arts fan Bruce Lee
famous pronounced intercostals sorts of, know,
bridging exercise, et cetera. muscles. them, even
us, us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. breathe


couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.

different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing
neurogenesis, least no data support it, can't make new
neurons, also can't damage ones got, shouldn't much
possible. blood brain barrier BBB. BBB
called prevents substances getting brain, however, like fence, not
always uniform along length. little spots within fence
chemicals can sneak across brain beautiful design, don't know
anything design. always say, wasn't consulted design phase. not
talking kind intelligent design anything not topic

podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens

brain stem. neurons brainstem triggered presence certain
chemicals. reason don't blood brain barrier location
post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided

thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain

Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.

highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap

ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

actually really encourages certain things order adjust chemistry.
first principle everyone understand sense self
sensing mechanical chemical information every organ body,
except one, brain. brain actually doesn't pain receptors.
doesn't even touch receptors. brain command center. helps drive
govern changes organs body. brain doesn't move, least not
much. can move little bit fluid moves within it. long healthy, not
moving much. brain no sensation own, fact, brain
surgery people, will size put anesthesia scalp. cut
away skin people don't feel anything. use anesthesia
peel back skin use a, call is, bone saw.
basically saw open little window skull. actually done
seen before. done many times before, inside brain,
can put electrodes can put various things there, course,
therapeutic purposes. without anesthesia actual brain tissue,
no receptors sense anything. doesn't pain receptors. doesn't
pressure receptors. None that, headache head, feels
like much pressure, well lie outside brain.
organs different. need tell brain going on.
ways can control mechanical chemical state organs ways
powerful, crucial do, can properly regulate
mechanical chemical environment body, brain functions better.
absolutely clear data gut healthy, get alkalinity right,
acidity, right, spleen healthy happy, lungs working
properly, not just breathing pumping air, breathing right
cadence particular activity, brain will function better. talk
can adjust mechanical chemical environment organs order
make brain better brain can make mechanical chemical
environment within organs function better. instance going talk
can change chemistry gut order brain able focus
better, think better, remember better sleep better. going talk
can change chemistry organs body, immune
system will function better otherwise. can actually heal faster
small cuts



00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue

bruises, also injuries kind, even major injuries. mentioned before,
got organs, heart, lungs, diaphragm, explain is,
gut spleen. spleen immune organ. take one example
explain mechanical chemical information particular set
organs communicates brain changes brain works.
organ like focus first lungs diaphragm. familiar
lungs, two big bags air, actually not two big bags air.
actually little tiny sacs within them, actually millions little sacs called alveoli
lungs. alveoli lungs like little tiny balloons throughout lungs,
balloons, have, air can actually contain.
not big bags air there, lungs, actually millions millions
little tiny bags air within lungs. little bags air can fill can
deflate, right, just like lungs overall can fill can deflate. diaphragm
muscle, kind shaped like dome. kind a, know, think
basketball soccer ball air pushed it. kind
crescent shape dome shaped, sits lungs way diaphragm
lungs work together interesting. diaphragm actually skeletal
muscles. just like bicep quadricep. fact skeletal muscle
important unique property, can control voluntarily.
can decide take control diaphragm just consciously deciding want
breathe particular way, just like can take conscious control legs.
will work just fine, not thinking them, walk provide,
already know walk, moment, can decide change rate
walking, so-called cadence walking. diaphragm skeletal muscle also
property, diaphragm moves down, depending breathe,
rather, say diaphragm moves determines
breathe. breathe also dependent little muscles ribs,
intercostals muscles, martial arts fan Bruce Lee
famous pronounced intercostals sorts of, know,
bridging exercise, et cetera. muscles. them, even
us, us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. breathe


couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing
neurogenesis, least no data support it, can't make new
neurons, also can't damage ones got, shouldn't much
possible. blood brain barrier BBB. BBB
called prevents substances getting brain, however, like fence, not
always uniform along length. little spots within fence
chemicals can sneak across brain beautiful design, don't know
anything design. always say, wasn't consulted design phase. not
talking kind intelligent design anything not topic
podcast. not philosophy podcast, religion podcast, science
podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens
acidic, neurons area postrema neurons chemo receptor trigger zone,
CTZ called, trigger bunch motor reflexes abdominal wall make
barf. Okay, feeling need throw triggered neurons
brain stem. neurons brainstem triggered presence certain
chemicals. reason don't blood brain barrier location
post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-
trauma cause vomiting. example, whereby memories, context, also
just chemistry internal state triggering behaviors hardwired.
reflux driven. people get nauseous
others given level, well, alcohol tolerance. people
called a, know, refer stronger stomach stomach steel.
people throw easily don't feel well, ingest anything
just little bit off. purely adaptive standpoint, probably better vomit

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak

horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals

create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,

talked sensing gut volume, intestinal volume, absence
volume. talked chemistry gut gut microbiota auto immune
functions. now talked vomiting, talked fever, lots
aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror

Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue

bruises, also injuries kind, even major injuries. mentioned before,
got organs, heart, lungs, diaphragm, explain is,
gut spleen. spleen immune organ. take one example
explain mechanical chemical information particular set
organs communicates brain changes brain works.
organ like focus first lungs diaphragm. familiar
lungs, two big bags air, actually not two big bags air.
actually little tiny sacs within them, actually millions little sacs called alveoli
lungs. alveoli lungs like little tiny balloons throughout lungs,
balloons, have, air can actually contain.
not big bags air there, lungs, actually millions millions
little tiny bags air within lungs. little bags air can fill can
deflate, right, just like lungs overall can fill can deflate. diaphragm
muscle, kind shaped like dome. kind a, know, think
basketball soccer ball air pushed it. kind
crescent shape dome shaped, sits lungs way diaphragm
lungs work together interesting. diaphragm actually skeletal
muscles. just like bicep quadricep. fact skeletal muscle
important unique property, can control voluntarily.
can decide take control diaphragm just consciously deciding want
breathe particular way, just like can take conscious control legs.
will work just fine, not thinking them, walk provide,
already know walk, moment, can decide change rate
walking, so-called cadence walking. diaphragm skeletal muscle also
property, diaphragm moves down, depending breathe,
rather, say diaphragm moves determines
breathe. breathe also dependent little muscles ribs,
intercostals muscles, martial arts fan Bruce Lee
famous pronounced intercostals sorts of, know,
bridging exercise, et cetera. muscles. them, even
us, us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. breathe


couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers

Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move

within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods

aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

couple things happen, talk mechanical things first. talk
mechanical steps relate back brain
brain. can promise develop awareness mechanical
changes, not go extensive breathwork practice extensive
breathwork. will immediately believe not develop sense breathing self
lungs diaphragm. takes no practice, it, will forever
changed terms awareness breathing ability leverage
breathing. Kind like steering wheel car order shift brain
direction want go.

00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate Breathing

powerful system. way works following. will also
incorporate heart, so, heart, don't mean emotional sense.
Although don't rule emotions Huberman Lab podcast, like
emotions, talking heart organ, beating organ, circulates
blood. inhale, little sacs lungs fill lungs expand.
that, take space thoracic cavity diaphragm moves
down, okay. exhale, diaphragm moves up, lungs get smaller, okay?
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. actually controls
heart rate, changing way brain works. works
following way. inhale, lungs fill diaphragm moves down. heart
actually little space diaphragm's moved down. heart gets
little bit bigger, physically bigger, not emotional sense, physically bigger.
consequence, whatever blood heart flows slower rate
larger volume, bigger volume heart, amount blood inside heart means
slower flow. Okay, sort like expanding pipe. brain registers
set neurons heart called sinoatrial node. sends information
brain. information registered brain brain sends message
back heart speed heart up. every time inhale
mechanical changes diaphragm lungs, mechanical
changes heart, brain sends signal heart speed heart up,
long inhales inhale vigorously, actually speeding heart
up. Now, course exhale well. instance, inhale


long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today

talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

long like [inhales heavily] entire time heart rate increasing.
quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, kept that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] heart rate increase. not going increase
linearly forever, will increase inhale. can simply make
inhales vigorous. [inhales quickly] heart rate will speed up.
autonomic automatic relationship diaphragm, lungs, brain,
heart. Now, inhale speed heart up, happens exhales?
exhale, diaphragm moves up. little counterintuitive, can kind think
like pushing plunge syringe, right? exhale, thing
moves diaphragm moves up, heart less space. Meaning gets
little bit smaller, means whatever volume blood inside heart moves
faster, smaller volume, information sent brain via
collection neurons called sinoatrial node aficionados. brain sends
information via vagus nerve back heart, slow heart down.
inhales speed heart, net effect exhales, slow heart down.
reason slow heart register change mechanical
pressure diaphragm, lungs heart. me, simplest
straightforward example brain changing way organs work,
heart case, according changes mechanical interoception. Now, not
always aware this, us aware it, us aren't. right now,
will aware it, can try this. can basically, experiment
example interoception, sensing one's self. inhale, doesn't matter long
inhale. couple seconds [inhales quickly] exhale twice long.
[exhales slowly] Nose mouth, doesn't matter, entire time exhaling,
slowing heart down. just car accelerator brake,
can slow car coming off accelerator. exhale, effectively coming
off accelerator, want think differently, hitting brake,
slowing heart rate. Now, normally heart rate stays less
range given activity inhaling exhaling. just
simple way showing mechanical changes viscera can change way
brain works brain changes way viscera work.
concrete agreement, like contract organs body
brain. fact, can think contract detail, can leverage
powerful way set conditions mind. want


calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm

01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing

little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's

little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next

neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit

cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions

thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can

want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body

highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap

ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

calm, emphasize exhales, simplest way this. talked many
times before, haven't heard say it, will become immediately clear
emphasize exhales called physiological sigh. Two inhales,
nose mouth, ideally nose, [inhales quickly twice]
followed long exhale. [exhales slowly] double inhales kind important
maximally fill little sacs lungs,
breathe out, exhaling much so-called carbon dioxide
system possible. talk carbon oxide second. fastest way
calm emphasize exhales. make exhales longer, slowing
heart rate, calming down. don't need sophisticated training.
don't minutes end. don't anything. don't even
call breathwork. just respiration, fact, every night.
go sleep carbon dioxide builds much bloodstream,
hold breath something, watch animal small child sleeping,
will occasionally double inhale long exhales way slowing heart
eliminating carbon oxide. opposite also true. inhale deeply
vigorously exhale less long less vigorously, will increase level
alertness purely mechanical aspects interoception.
instance, take big deep inhale [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] another one, big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale,
[exhales quickly] takes two three start feel alert.
heart rate increasing. actually keep
25 30 breaths inhale deep short exhale, will start secrete lot adrenaline.
hormone comes kidneys brainstem make feel
really alert. will actually feel cup espresso. will
immediately wake up. intermediate form breathing, sometimes
called box breathing, really equal inhale exhale duration. these,
basically goes like this. going inhale, maybe two, three
seconds inhale, [inhales] hold, okay, two, three seconds. exhale, two, three
seconds. hold two, three seconds. often people forget hold. inhale,
hold, exhale, hold equal less equal durations, one second,
two seconds, three seconds. people find get past
five seconds, start struggle maintain so-called box breathing.
people can't consciously box breathe terribly long without think it.


point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale

Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods
keeping

seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,

turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,
front, called ventricles, start called lateral ventricles
excuse me, starts third lateral ventricles, goes
fourth ventricle called central canal. basically just big
space middle nervous system middle brain.


one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal
fluid fills ventricle. words, neurons sensing
chemistry cerebral spinal fluid, access therefore chemistry
body. cerebral spinal fluid going brain spinal
cord. cerebral spinal fluid signals various chemicals within
body. not mechanical system. chemical system. Remember
talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing
there. course, locally, will effects, little things called mast cell. M-A-
S-T little packets histamine literally will go explode [poofs] cause
inflammation, actually good inflammation. release little things called
macrophages gobble infection. day, Texas,
mean little mosquitoes Texas, lot them, stand outside get
bitten, didn't feel thing, later night, started swelling itching
itch them, swell even more.
release mass cells, histamines inside mass cells literally causing
inflammation tissue. wasn't poison mosquito itself.
immune response those. Well, also systemic body-wide attempt kill
stuff, fever. neurons ventricles cerebral spinal fluid
go particular name, called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum,
ventricular near ventricles. organs set
neurons, really cool name called OVLT. don't know like that, just
like it, organum vasculosum lateral terminalis organum vasculosum
lateral terminalis, OVLT neurons respond toxins bad stuff
bloodstream, however minor major. release things like ILK-1,
inflammatory cytokines inflammatory case good, want inflammation
site infection. good thing. going help healing. going
change conditions body, going happen OVLT
neurons activated, something bad body something bad
happening body, communicate area brain called


preoptic area hypothalamus preoptic area cranks temperature
tries cook bad thing. Now worth talking fever moment
talking thermal regulation, think actually save lives.
overheated point where, know, getting past 102 103,
going vary depending person person certainly age, know, kids,
people think can tolerate higher levels fever adults, look, always want
cautious heating brain much, neurons
gone, not come back neurons not well high temperatures.
body temperature starts getting 102, 103, certainly 104, starting
enter serious danger zone. can happen exercise hot environments
inability escape heat don't covering adequate ventilation
cooling. can also excessive fever,

01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling Blood Properly

whatever reason. lot people think way deal put cool
compress back neck cool torso. discussing
colleague, Craig Heller Stanford School Medicine,
undergraduate side campus well, runs biology lab. world expert
thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic
area, will heat can cook brain organs further.
want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism
OVLT,

01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress

sensing chemistry OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis that. talked sensing lung volume, speed heartbeat,
talked sensing gut volume, intestinal volume, absence
volume. talked chemistry gut gut microbiota auto immune
functions. now talked vomiting, talked fever, lots
aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter
chemistry gut ways vagus nerve quiets
neurons communicate gut brain. want say again, stress will disrupt
gut make feel not good, poor digestion, just lousy, way
shuts vagus nerve neurons gut. stress


blocks communication gut brain, doesn't mess gut. just
doesn't let gut get signals brain, also throws off
chemistry. whole cascade effects. want learn
stress, whole episode called "Master Stress," think maybe called
"Conquer Stress" "Master Stress," either one. whole point episode
give tools practices deal short term, acute stress, moderate term
stress, long-term chronic stress behavioral mechanisms,

01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions

nutrition, supplementation, many things well. chockablock full
protocols tools stress. vagus nerve, however, responsible emotion
way pool, aggregate conditions gut, conditions
heart conditions breathing, includes diaphragm
lungs takes kind collection information sends brain
controls call emotions. Now might seem obvious people,
people might seem totally crazy. thought emotions
market invested, something thought
going happen not going happen, thought school open
not, maybe thought wasn't, whatever bothers you,
think generally purely cognitive event. brain doesn't really know
information. doesn't act directly information create moods.
Moods created heart's response reading headline, change
breathing, caused someone love telling actually
not interested spending time anymore, screwed
interested spending lot time like that, right? Emotions can
good bad neutral. thing call interoception, sense self
building fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune
systems, auto-immune might've thinking, wait, thought going
sense self, noticing feeling. indeed things
plugging like series ingredients recipe gives rise mood
feel, mood feel shown one location body
people can see. facial expressions. indeed now
beautiful data showing face, including size pupils, tonality


face, flushed are, pale are, even degree
frowning smiling relative periods time, aggregate of,
reflection rather gut, heart breathing chemistry
body. sort backed conversation interoception kind
Trojan horse purpose talk vagus
hear, oh, know, can get vagal tone breathing rubbing front
short probably true, another fundamental layer acidity gut,
fast breathing inhale-emphasized, exhale-emphasized breathing.
relaxed pupils tend constrict. alert, pupils
tend dilated, whether not alertness happy sad.

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked
nervous system, links work specific ways. whether
not remember pesos GLPRs stuff, doesn't really
matter. encourage start sort pushing

point purely mechanical means changing way
breathe, emphasizing inhales exhales, keeping will change way
brain works, alert well function anything.
again, doesn't mean breathwork no value. just simply say long
extended protocols breathwork simply, truly simply just exploration
fundamental relationship mechanics

00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors

internal organs brain brain controls internal organs.
Now might ask, well, pressure known? body actually know
full lungs are, now? answer aficionados there,
requests, say thousands requests in-depth
science, not interested depth science, just will allow tune
now maybe just 10 seconds, interested, pay careful attention,
set receptors called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. discovered years ago couple different
laboratories, one main ones, one main laboratories discovered
piezo receptors laboratory Ardem Patapoutian. love saying name,
even though probably pronouncing it, friend former colleague
lab San Diego, Scripps Institute, Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator, basically means total stud science
made many important discoveries. piezo receptors line many tissues, inform
brain pressure tissues. lungs particular category piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. fill lungs little sacs
air, alveoli fill, piezo two receptors way react filling
send information way bunch neurons, bunch wires brain tell
full lungs are, kind mechanistic detail. want learn
that, can look Ardem's lab Scripps beautiful work
laboratories piezos, piezos pretty cool.

00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, Air Blood

think also just like saying piezo, brought well. mechanical


sensing lungs, heart diaphragm. now talk chemical sensing
carbon dioxide oxygen. really simple.
oxygen carbon dioxide need both. sometimes hear people talk
carbon dioxide bad thing oxygen, good thing. need both,
need appropriate balance. collection neurons
brain register carbon dioxide levels get certain point bloodstream.
point, threshold reached, neurons fire, cause
breathe sometimes called gasp reflex, just makes want inhale.
consequence, bring oxygen. Okay, don't really breathe get oxygen.
by-product inhaling eliminate carbon dioxide. don't want carbon
dioxide levels go high. fact, want freak somebody
experiments, don't recommend this, just increase levels
carbon dioxide inhale, brain will go almost immediate panic
response health tissues depends keeping nice balance
carbon dioxide oxygen. don't want carbon dioxide levels go
high. impulse breathe, water, hold breath
triggered neurons triggering neurons comes elevated
carbon dioxide bloodstream. don't quite know
conceptualize relationship bloodstream breath, think important.
maybe remember high school biology, don't, make clear
now, easy. inhale air air oxygen molecules
air actually move lungs bloodstream little alveoli
lungs, little sacs air there, basically lot little micro vessels
capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries little tiny ones, line them, actually
interface opportunity air molecules within air pass blood
move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods

experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no

nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked

move bloodstream, exhale, opposite true.
can move things air, bloodstream bloodstream air
way lungs, lot detail it. sure
experts there. want put stuff comments, maybe little bit
kind intermediate tutorial, might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. know
lot this, just check it, make sure get details, right. Make sure
know process. find people interested understanding
breathing really works, really nice think relationship heart


vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods
keeping

esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,
front, called ventricles, start called lateral ventricles
excuse me, starts third lateral ventricles, goes
fourth ventricle called central canal. basically just big
space middle nervous system middle brain.


one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal

talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing

bitten, didn't feel thing, later night, started swelling itching
itch them, swell even more.
release mass cells, histamines inside mass cells literally causing
inflammation tissue. wasn't poison mosquito itself.
immune response those. Well, also systemic body-wide attempt kill
stuff, fever. neurons ventricles cerebral spinal fluid
go particular name, called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum,
ventricular near ventricles. organs set
neurons, really cool name called OVLT. don't know like that, just
like it, organum vasculosum lateral terminalis organum vasculosum
lateral terminalis, OVLT neurons respond toxins bad stuff

neurons activated, something bad body something bad
happening body, communicate area brain called


preoptic area hypothalamus preoptic area cranks temperature
tries cook bad thing. Now worth talking fever moment
talking thermal regulation, think actually save lives.
overheated point where, know, getting past 102 103,
going vary depending person person certainly age, know, kids,
people think can tolerate higher levels fever adults, look, always want
cautious heating brain much, neurons
gone, not come back neurons not well high temperatures.
body temperature starts getting 102, 103, certainly 104, starting
enter serious danger zone. can happen exercise hot environments
inability escape heat don't covering adequate ventilation
cooling. can also excessive fever,

01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling Blood Properly

whatever reason. lot people think way deal put cool
compress back neck cool torso. discussing
colleague, Craig Heller Stanford School Medicine,
undergraduate side campus well, runs biology lab. world expert
thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic

want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism
OVLT,

01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress

sensing chemistry OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis that. talked sensing lung volume, speed heartbeat,
talked sensing gut volume, intestinal volume, absence
volume. talked chemistry gut gut microbiota auto immune
functions. now talked vomiting, talked fever, lots
aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter
chemistry gut ways vagus nerve quiets
neurons communicate gut brain. want say again, stress will disrupt
gut make feel not good, poor digestion, just lousy, way
shuts vagus nerve neurons gut. stress


blocks communication gut brain, doesn't mess gut. just
doesn't let gut get signals brain, also throws off
chemistry. whole cascade effects. want learn

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

vascular system, blood air system, respiration system,
breathing, two things very, say, interdigitated,
interwoven one another. work, well, carbon dioxide high,
breathe in, inspire, you,

00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert Calm

inhale off consequence, exhale, offload carbon dioxide.
really cool way can explore chemistry breathing
bloodstream way brain works ways can really benefit
health. works following way. want essentially sit lie down. doesn't
really matter. definitely don't want anywhere near water, not bathtub, not
hot tub, not a, know, not cold dunk something. fact, don't even puddle.
want case going breathe deep. going
increase heart rate exhale passively just letting air fall
mouth. will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively]
breathe vigorously let air just fall mouth.
that, essentially bringing lot oxygen
deep breath. exhaling little bit carbon dioxide.
repeat 25 times, maybe 30 times, doesn't matter 25 30, somewhere there,
essentially start bringing lot oxygen blowing off exhaling lot
carbon dioxide. actually going change chemistry internal
landscape, can sense it. can interocept like.
really interesting reasons wanting that, not going 25 30
now, maybe five 10, can get sense looks like, clear.
going essentially demonstrate now, inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale
mouth,[exhales] inhaling nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] essentially, excuse me, two second inhale
one second exhale, that, can kind feel face get
flush body heating brain heating up, happening there?
Well pattern breathing increasing levels adrenaline brain body,
getting alert. 25 30 those, exhale air. [exhales
deeply] dump air. can that, nose mouth.
hold breath lungs empty 15 30 seconds. Now,


want explore this, please careful explore this, don't
anything stupid, like driving something like that. can exhale
air find can hold breath long time.
reason can blown off carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide bloodstream. shifted chemistry blood
breathing particular way. that, no longer triggering
neurons cause gasp reflex reflex breathe. Now, course
breathe sooner later find normally ability hold breath
minute really feel gasp reflex kick in, might find can
go 90 seconds two minutes. practice, people find can start
holding breath three four minutes longer. actually free divers
do. not want anyone free diving. going learn free diving,
please learn expert. Many people die trying teach free
dive trying teach friends free dive don't know
doing. not about, don't again, don't anywhere near water,
interesting exploration can shift chemistry bloodstream
modulating air modulating mechanics diaphragm lungs
thereby shift way mind works, brain. fact, notice
even though 25 30 breaths, [inhales exhales quickly] feel
alert, exhale air breath hold, will feel alert,
calm. Now interesting state sort want
achieve alert, calm, hard time achieving.
hard time obtaining focus sake work focus sake anything
say, able achieve focus, use things like
stimulants, feel like cold shower ice bath,
four espresso order alert, alert, jittery. can't
focus. pattern breathing can lend well entering states alert,
calm fall, 10 even 20 minutes follow breathing.
repeat want. useful practice explore. may
familiar practice so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof practitioner
called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing around centuries.
familiar breathwork yoga practices, acknowledged
nothing just described new based science, however, science informs
practices work. just little mini editorial, just want emphasize well.


one thing podcast really trying remove fancy nomenclature,
whether not yogic nomenclature scientific nomenclature people can
access protocols. moment start naming things people calling
Tumo et cetera, no problem that, doesn't inform practices
done, inform underlying mechanisms. trying teach
mechanisms. final point that, powerful form breathing
one takes account fundamental mechanisms increase heart rate,
exhales decrease heart rate, carbon dioxide oxygen relate
bloodstream brain particular ways, understand components,
can create so-called breathwork practices. can breathe
ways best serve you, opposed thinking one protocol best holy
protocol everything, simply not. final final point, want say
shift way breathe, whether not showing off carbon
dioxide bringing oxygen, fundamentally changing chemistry
internal milieu body, shown important effects
way immune system functions way deal
inflammation sorts different sort things can enter body cause
problems conditions stress, et cetera. will explore episode
goes on, want move just touch one aspect reading, purely
mechanical, think interesting important, relates particular
reflex

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.
learn swim, learn swim air lungs
underwater no air lungs underwater. event Hering
Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today

going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look

seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe

Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe

hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick

move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain

start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open

throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious

subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look

interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start

00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex

going familiar second. can serve well
times extreme stress. reflex referring something called Hering Breuer
Reflex. not going go details Hering Breuer reflex works,
particular classes neurons cells called Baroreceptors.
basically pressure receptors, sense pressure. basically
Hering Breuer reflex lung inflated, desire breathe
reduced. can try right now, can inhale [inhales] huge big thing air.
hold, okay? desire breathe will kick later exhale
air hold breath. exhale air breath, unless
done sort protocol described minutes ago bunch inhales


exhales first deliberate way, will feel empty. Baroreceptors going
firing like crazy saying, no pressure here, no pressure here, got
nothing here. need breathe, need breathe in, gasp reflex will kick
sooner. can apply sorts situations related exercise, related
modulating stress, et cetera. Hering Breuer reflex powerful one.
take big deep breath go water. [inhales heavily] right,
not going exhale air go water. exhale
air go water, absolutely feel need come sooner
breath air full tank, speak full lungs full air. also
way people teach feel comfortable water.

Breuer reflex yet another dimension way mechanical pressure influences

00:42:47 Gut Volume & Desire Open Mouth

brain's decision-making, body, case, whether
not breathe. now want shift away breathing diaphragm lungs
move toward another organ within viscera, gut. includes
stomach intestines, esophagus forth. said before,
others are, series tubes, indeed true. Believe
not, every system body tube. brain actually tube connects
spinal cord, also tube. started off tube, like churro.
know, churros don't know not familiar churros, like donuts
shaped like tube. essentially look like early development,
not long conception front end churro grew grew grew,
always maintained hollow tube. called
ventricles, gaps space brain spinal cord run length brain
spinal cord fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, things move
space. going return ventricles later, important. just
space filled fluid, lot. Similarly digestive system starts
tube mouth course goes throat. got
elements stomach intestines, comes end.
are, series different tubes, vascular system, series tubes.


tubes. way digestive system works communicate brain
status mechanical pressures along tube, within stomach
intestines, et cetera, chemical status tube various portions
within tube inform brain brain control tube.
start mechanical sensing gut. drink lot fluid, eat
lot food, gut will fill up, stomach will fill food. Now gets digested
there. gets digested elsewhere along digestive track too, course starts
getting digested along tube, series called
sphincters, basically like little draw pulls. ever laundry bag,
drawstring it? pull cinches shut, can open
again, are. sphincter openings
throat, along digestive tract, way end. Food will enter
gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good
practice, not big fan competitions. even one people
world heavyweight champion them, informative toward
talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part
lack food gut sent information brain driving particular
fixed action patterns associated eating, fact, one first things
children learn open mouth something presented it.
learn move spoon fork. not good it, first, get
place, eventually get good at, least people get good
watch people eat, know, kind variable there. event,
purely mechanical phenomenon. purely mechanical phenomenon driving
brain

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice

recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people

hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going

again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe

gut. lot food, pressure receptors,
piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell

ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous

intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical

another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually

big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious

subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look

hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe

piezo receptors will communicate areas brain involved feeding,
say, don't eat anymore. don't need consume anymore, now,
people bypass these, guess like hotdog eating competitions.
always struck people like, seem rail thin,
actually train competitions ingesting large volumes water, actually
dangerous practice. can actually kill drinking much water,
can kill ingesting much anything, really expand gut, not good

talking now, expand gut, signal sent neurons,
literally nerve cells gut brain, stem areas brain
involved feeding, whole episode feeding. can find "Feeding,
Metabolism Hunger." welcome listen episode, like,
shut neurons drive desire put stuff mouth. thing
people say sometimes well country frequently Thanksgiving meal,
can't put another bite mouth. Literally shut basic
movements musculature take another fork bite. know sounds crazy,
can actually control brain. gut full controlling brains,
action spooning food towards mouth actually inhibited. made
difficult less likely occur. incredible. converse also true, piezo
receptors signal brain, gut empty independent need, actual


need food. signal sent brain says gut empty neurons
get stimulated areas like arcuate nucleus areas hypothalamus
et cetera, drive desire make action, open mouth put
stuff particular food. find refrigerator find
almost, know, manically trying get food different cons, not even
thinking eating, hungry, part

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell

food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods
keeping

seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,

hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections

00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting

drive certain behavior. can get better registering sense fullness lack
fullness particular way. people keen sense full
empty stomach is, eaten anything, even small volume food
last hour three hours, actually worthwhile practice take moments,
maybe 10, 20 seconds, actually just try concentrate sensing neurons
gut full are, like instance, ate hours ago
little snack 30 minutes ago so. gut feels neither terribly full terribly
empty. kind of, put kind like 30, 40% okay. just taking conscious
awareness full empty gut various times meals, meal,
meal, can quickly develop sense full empty are. Now,
consequence that? consequence actually rather interesting.
shown consequence actually can better override
signals piezo receptors gut fullness emptiness.
find eat kind compulsively non-consciously, subconsciously,
say, probably conscious enough awake eat, subconsciously
just find eating describing myself, like, drive blueberry
eater. bowl blueberries, every time walk past it, sort grab


handful pop mouth, develop sense much
mecho-pressure, not really word, much mechano-sensation gut,
quickly, can learn override that. might ask, want able
override whether not stomach empty stomach full? Well,
many reasons want that. Many people right now interested so-called
intermittent fasting. fast anywhere 12 16 hours, every 24 hour
cycle, actually practice is. regular basis, sometimes the,
eat breakfast, normally pushed breakfast 11 noon, sometimes
little later, people longer fast, really wonderful data
publishing excellent journals colleagues Satchin Panda Salk Institute
Biological Studies. course laboratories showing intermittent
fasting can will positive health effects things like liver health brain
health aspects health. Whether not best form dieting
sake losing weight, controversial, clear period
fasting every 24 hours perhaps even longer time time can beneficial
stimulates called autophagy, clearing away, body's ability
eat certain dead cells, called senescent cells, many people, struggle
fasting feel keen sense stomach empty.
feel eat. kind counter-intuitive way,
data indicate able sense whether not gut full empty,
just knowledge communicating information brain whether
not eat not just awareness, understanding allows override
signal. think, oh, know, not actually need nutrients right now. just
stomach empty. piezo receptors, ones tell
moment signaling brain empty. don't actually need
food, just, just brain reacting

00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods
keeping

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

fact gut deflated, speak smaller, doesn't food it.
ways guts communicate brain, not just stomach
talking brain. also intestines talk brain. Liberles Lab guy's
name Steven Liberles, runs lab Harvard Medical School, terrific lab,
excellent work gut, brain communication aspects viscera brain


communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms

neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break

brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.

don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing
neurogenesis, least no data support it, can't make new
neurons, also can't damage ones got, shouldn't much
possible. blood brain barrier BBB. BBB
called prevents substances getting brain, however, like fence, not
always uniform along length. little spots within fence
chemicals can sneak across brain beautiful design, don't know
anything design. always say, wasn't consulted design phase. not
talking kind intelligent design anything not topic
podcast. not philosophy podcast, religion podcast, science
podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens

brain stem. neurons brainstem triggered presence certain
chemicals. reason don't blood brain barrier location
post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-
trauma cause vomiting. example, whereby memories, context, also
just chemistry internal state triggering behaviors hardwired.
reflux driven. people get nauseous
others given level, well, alcohol tolerance. people
called a, know, refer stronger stomach stomach steel.
people throw easily don't feel well, ingest anything

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak

horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.

cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,

aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked

communication. discovered category neurons called GLP1R neurons,
neurons basically neck, mean, part nervous
system, they're, can, can found near neck. neurons send
little wires intestines deep stomach, mostly
intestines sense stretch intestines. pretty wild. neurons
sense stretched intestines fast things moving
intestines, slow fast, nothing there. neurons send
another branch, branch one direction, senses going
intestines. another branch goes neck brain
either trigger desire eat just stop eating. really cool neurons
basically stretch receptors. look lot like piezo receptors
talked before, GLP1R neurons sensing stretch, purely mechanical
sensing. addition that, Liberles Lab discovered neurons detect
nutrients themselves. Now, main reason need eat bring nutrients
body. another set neurons, called GPR65 neurons,
want know, don't remember that, thing terms
connections. send connections intestines gut,
stomach, mostly intestines. send information back
brain whether not certain kinds nutrients digestive track. Now,
neurons ones pay attention talking chemical signaling
next couple minutes, going tell can
understand hunger modulate hunger right foods, fact,
healthy foods. way done leveraging activity GPR65
neurons, neurons sense nutrients, okay. telling brain
gut intestines, another set neurons discovered
another guy Duke University, name Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges
wonderful scientist. degree nutrition, also neuroscience.
found neurons line gut, neurons collaboration
GPR65 neurons sensing three things, okay? say nutrients,
nutrients looking for? neurons paying attention to?
neurons activated presence fatty acids particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
sorts things come fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds animal protein, animal,
plant substances. can look lot omega-3s omega-3s
make neurons fire electrically like crazy brain make want eat


things, turns pretty appropriate levels. neurons also
respond amino acids. eat food, broken gut, actually
way broken gut kind interesting. gut basically cinches off
sphincter top, cinches off sphincter food there.
series smooth muscles tumble food literally physically break
down. course, enzymes come start digesting food.
going talk digestion communicated brain moment.
autoimmune issues digestive issues, going
important conversation. meanwhile neurons gut
fatty acids float digested food, literally fat molecules, amino
acids coming proteins digested gut. third food
item, sugars coming foods eat. neurons will fire lot
brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb
mouth, neurons don't care mouth. care nutrients
coming foods. signal brain, hey, thing,
thing lift object, call fork spoon, thing drink
milkshake,

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner
real estate, case, way chemical signaling, not way mechanical
signaling. now like talk another aspect

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious

esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially

neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit

interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions

thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can

want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body

highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms

start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe

brain says, Hey, whatever there, it, okay? Now
sugars little bit cryptic say sugars say amino acids, say
fatty acids, nothing taste. fact, beautiful experiments
done Borges Lab labs showing even numb mouth,
even gavavge, really, just a, fancy word basically tube feeding,
put tube gut, just deliver food gut. get no
opportunity taste, sounds pretty awful. force feed gavage, numb

00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings Specific Amino Acid Nutrients

thing move mouth like this, not talking, thing
swallow. nutrients gut control us. people
experience extreme sugar cravings, even mild sugar cravings, replacing
foods foods high levels omega-3 amino acids can produce sugar
cravings. talked previous episode, didn't catch it, no
big deal. tell right now many people, solution sugar cravings
ingest small amount, maybe teaspoon amino acid called glutamine.
really extreme sugar cravings, can even mix glutamine full-fat


cream, actually makes taste pretty darn good. drink anytime
sugar craving just sip two that. find sugar cravings
disappear, basically giving fat amino acids neurons
gut intestine, signal brain want more. Now, doesn't
give kind runaway hunger full fat cream. Although will say
high school various reasons, mostly liked way tastes. using
half half cereal. waking middle night drinking half
half, stuff tastes pretty darn good get used high fat content.
Not something now. point neurons don't really know taste,
know nutrients. can work system crave sugar,
believe not us trying limit, not eliminate simple sugars,
much possible time, things like glutamine, things like high omega-
3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want supplement fish oil something similar
get omega-3s, reasons wanting too, can beneficial.
talking interoception, ability sense inner

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins

blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious

right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look

experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no

nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap

ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate

00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)

gut chemistry profound effects brain, well immune
system. auto-immune conditions, know
people auto-immune conditions, going important discussion.
gut needs maintain certain level acidity alkalinity, without
chemistry background, basically low numbers pH scale, means
acidic, higher, numbers, alkaline, alkaline means basic
acidic means acidic. hydrogen atoms stuff,
don't need worry right now. not going pH gut right
now, going talk pH gut. gut needs acidic
essentially tissues body order function properly, bacteria thrive
alkaline conditions. think important people understand. People
always thinking, oh, alkaline acidic, almost sounds like
inflamed well, know, complicated discussion, think semantics
can confusing, sometimes want gut acidic. may ask, well,


people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times
need breathe mouth whatever reason, hard exercise eating
speaking, breathing nose, time creating
additional layer immune defense particles get sick. Whereas
mouth breathe, taking layer defense putting
risk infection.

01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented

paper shows. also gut microbiome throat,
stomach intestines. gut microbiome extremely powerful
regulating mood immune function. Now, not something can
sense directly. don't know bunch good microbiota bunch
bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether
not gut alkaline acidic appropriate ways, will populate gut
appropriate microbiota. want stomach pretty acidic,
elements digestive tract going pH. basically
gradient, meaning low high pH gradient along gut. don't
know pH one given point, not going go
put microbiota one location not another. essentially want create
environment proper can thrive, that, greatly
decrease called inflammatory cytokines. things secreted
cells, within body cells within brain impact brain health brain


function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind

pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-

01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,

seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing

can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal

people taking antacids? Well, antacids particular purpose
essentially combat acid reflux, sending stuff gut towards
esophagus. can cause heartburn things sort. way antacids
work essentially cause sphincters gut sinch shut, really
dealing symptom, not cause. rewind, 10, 20 years ago,
discussion gut acidity quite bit different now scientific
medical literature. fact, many years long before, going say here,
people saying important maintain proper acidity gut,
science medical professions sort looked kind scance like,
know, going there, don't, don't know evidence
actually true, communities people prescribing, say
recommending people take hydrochloric acid HCL adjusting gut acidity
way. kind frowned upon, now looking peer reviewed literature,
clear business trying make gut little acidic actually one
way people treat try ameliorate acid reflux. kind counterintuitive
increasing acidity gut try reduce acid reflux, thought supposed
take antacids, well, field shifted quite bit. going review
maintain chemistry gut slightly acidic level aesthetic
level, say, turns number things gut
just call is, gastric juice, sounds kind gross. gastric juices
actually powerful modulators brain state. Put differently, one best things
can healthy brain, well-functioning brain healthy well-
functioning body maintain proper gut chemistry. basically accomplished
getting right level acidity alkalinity gut. Now not quack
pseudoscience. not based cleanses anything sort. Well, going
talk now peer reviewed data

01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome

high quality journals, like Journal Cell, one three apex science
nature, so, journals sort, point gut microbiome relationship
acidity gut gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune
function various aspects brain body health. within mucosal
lining tissues body, called microbiota, little micro organisms


didn't make actually come environment food live inside us.
good microbiota bad microbiota whether not
good microbiota bad microbiota depends one thing. one thing acid
alkaline given mucosal tissue is. actually microbiome nose.
just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention
performed humans. got microbiome nose nasal
breathing time, not time. Cause going times

inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human

huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets

01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,

things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking

directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start

just brief aside, remiss didn't say this, emphasize
nasal breathing time, except speaking eating. downplay
mouth breathing, meaning refrain mouth breathing, especially sleep,
improve nasal microbiome. gets better fighting off infections. shown
beautiful paper, published Cell Reports last year. paper mention

bad microbiota can feel moving around there, actually
pretty awful, pretty creepy feeling. Rather according whether

function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing
neurogenesis, least no data support it, can't make new
neurons, also can't damage ones got, shouldn't much
possible. blood brain barrier BBB. BBB
called prevents substances getting brain, however, like fence, not
always uniform along length. little spots within fence

podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens

post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain

aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked

function bodily health. go particular name, something called TNF
alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. inflammatory. not good thing
elevated levels. something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage tissues, not good thing elevated long
periods time. anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin
10, reduce inflammation. hundreds these, not thousands
different cytokines, promote inflammation, reduce
inflammation. simple way adjust things proper ratios adjust
gut microbiome. best way adjust microbiome ingest certain types
foods. beautiful literature now, important literature
one referred beginning episode, ingest
not ingest terms foods order create best conditions gut
can create best conditions brain body. study done
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg Stanford School Medicine. Justin's actually
upstairs neighbor building Stanford work explored
different foods different diets, say, impact gut microbiome
inflammatory markers. beautiful study done hundreds
human patients. actually weren't patients sick, say human
subjects otherwise healthy huge variety backgrounds,
men, women, people different races, different ethnicities.
huge range backgrounds tracked that.
explored two types diets. One high fiber diet. dietary fibers non-digestible
partially digestible carbohydrates typically. compared diets
unchanged, except inclusion few, servings fermented
foods, day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, even explored, sounds
pretty disgusting me, knows, never tried it, fermented cottage
cheese. found initial period weeks,
people either eat lot fiber eat one two servings fermented foods,
people ramp ingestion either fiber fermented foods, kind
ease it. went baseline ramp point
ingesting, know, four five servings fiber fermented foods per day,
sounds like lot. fermented foods, be, know, four five
tablespoons sauerkraut kimchi. not quite, not like huge platefuls
fermented foods. looked number things. looked


proteome, kind like looking genome, bunch proteins
made body. fecal samples, stool samples,
blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods
keeping



01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

talking kind intelligent design anything not topic
podcast. not philosophy podcast, religion podcast, science
podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens
acidic, neurons area postrema neurons chemo receptor trigger zone,
CTZ called, trigger bunch motor reflexes abdominal wall make
barf. Okay, feeling need throw triggered neurons
brain stem. neurons brainstem triggered presence certain
chemicals. reason don't blood brain barrier location
post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-
trauma cause vomiting. example, whereby memories, context, also
just chemistry internal state triggering behaviors hardwired.
reflux driven. people get nauseous
others given level, well, alcohol tolerance. people
called a, know, refer stronger stomach stomach steel.
people throw easily don't feel well, ingest anything
just little bit off. purely adaptive standpoint, probably better vomit


things aren't good rather pass system.
Especially things contained lipids. instance ingest something
liquid form cells, literally every cell body surrounded little

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,

thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic

want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism
OVLT,

01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress

sensing chemistry OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral

aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic

Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap

blood draw, great, real power study. fact,
comprehensive study aware of. looking different tissues across long
periods time, many weeks, returning people their, diet
went study, will able establish causal way,
ingesting fibers fibrous foods versus ingesting fermented foods daily
basis impact gut microbiome many inflammatory markers many
markers immune function auto immune function. takeaway message
study fermented foods far performed high fiber diet. fact,
high fiber diet people beneficial people caused issues
inflammation. different taught growing many
us taught. Interestingly also observed people ate high fiber diet
increases certain enzymes lend better digestion
carbohydrates. think important insight come this. Nowadays
kind live age extremes people seem either want carnivore
like never ingest vegetable, hear don't even like allow pepper, not
even allowed, know, sauerkraut something like extreme pure plant based,
pure vegan pure. essentially pure carbohydrate pure animal protein,
extreme. omnivore, like eat mixture different things different times
days, extreme, interesting this, data show
perhaps ingesting high carbohydrate high fiber diet, really these,
high-fiber condition really actually makes people better digesting
carbohydrates. may explain people used a, kind paleo
type carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates say, oh, doesn't work
me, don't feel good. might also explain people predominantly eat plant-
based foods carbohydrate foods will try eating meat experiment,
lost bet whatever desperation, that.
say, oh, don't feel good eat meat. good feel, seems well
can utilize food, much food crave may determined
fact, appears determined food eating history, types food eat.
think might explain divide hopefully might bridge chasm
different groups saying one way,



01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods

01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented
Foods

another. core study bigger message. bigger
message us ingesting regular basis, daily basis, two four
servings fermented foods different kinds. say
inflammatory markers went down, markers auto-immune disruption went down,
chemistry gut therefore adjusted appropriate ways. Now not
say high fiber bad fiber bad, don't want people confuse this,
even though discussion interoception, sensing self.
subconscious mechanism gut communicates many organs, including
brain. shown studies also quality peer review journals
correct gut microbiota present inflammatory markers reduced,
cognition improves ability focus, ability sleep ability ward off infection
wound healing enhanced, fact, even autism spectrum disorder, people
struggle various mental conditions disorders mind improving gut
microbiome seems powerful effects improving brain symptoms. Along
lines auto-immunity, number conditions call auto-immune
conditions, will entire episodes going forward. people
so-called irritable bowel syndrome, people Crohn's disease, people leaky
gut, Hashimoto's, kind immune system self-attack one's thyroid gland
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting gut microbiome shown
useful positively adjusting symptoms those, will fix conditions
entirely? Probably not.

01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine

can significant positive impact them? Probably, yes. one thing
worth mentioning list, leaky gut, leaky gut. Here,
talking guts, leaky gut, sounds awful. sounds like
something sort like leaking end tube, maybe too, don't know.
leaky gut actually because, gut not tube continuous, one cell
actually made many cells cells form barrier form
called tight junctions. two cells want create fence


cells, bind together. way body bind together
called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off
digestion. takes little bit experimentation, again, definitely talk
healthcare provider exploring this, become common practice
people auto-immune disorders accessing gut accessible
taking things also become way

01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog

people various mental conditions trying adjust mood adjust
wellbeing. Along lines, want mention studies show
people supplement lot probiotics even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. isn't discussed lot data little place,
thinking about. goal not create many microbiota
possible, want microbiota diversity. mention
reference Sonnenberg study, high fiber diet


increases certain microbiota, limits diversity fermented food diet
does, say diet includes regular ingestion fermented foods
servings day increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack microbiota diversity
name medical profession. called dysbiosis dysbiosis bad. Dysbiosis
see people spending long periods time bedrest
chronically ill, again, talking creating positive
environment gut, either adjusting acidity, maybe explore betaine HCL
pepsin thing. think healthy digestion, feel like good
relationship gut, good relationship you, sort silly phrase,
it, don't think need pursue this,
don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction
saying ingest fermented foods regular basis. also mention
conditions like sarcopenia, loss muscle tissue age,
shown offset improving gut microbiota. today
interoception, talking sensing, also talking subconscious
sensing. talking about, subconscious sensing, talking
subconscious sensing milieu body. milieu gut body
right, brain immune system function well. isn't
something can sit back say, oh, know, feel good
microbiota gut, or, oh, no, bad microbiota. can't unless
going take fecal samples blood samples analyze the,
extreme exhaustive nature Sonnenberg labs do, not going
get kind information. know companies this, don't
want knock them, want emphasize right, really
analyze cytokines making, ones not, really need look
huge number them. requires large-scale proteomic genomic
inflammatory markers screens. just not kind thing commercial
enterprises can really provide people way can interpret, rather,
case can simply go effector, thing can actually move
needle right direction you. clear fermented foods

neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit

interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided

thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

called tight junctions, are, go names like claudins things
like that, want look up. tight junctions form nice barrier, like
cyclone fence, things can't get past, like cyclone fence molecules
certain size can go holes. not going pass soccer ball
intact cyclone fence, pass instance, feather
fence. leaky gut conditions gut alkaline gut
microbiota off gut, meaning microbiota like alkaline guts living there.
tight junctions can't function particular pH create little holes
fence. happens ingest foods, foods
literally leak gut extracellular space bloodstream.
foods include proteins antibodies react proteins, ends
happening leaky gut, reason talk auto-immune conditions
start developing antibodies particular food proteins. people start feeling
like food allergies do, actually create particular food allergies.
Now, one way prevent leaky gut get rest gut situation happy
ingesting proper foods talked before, ingesting fermented foods
regular basis. old friend glutamine, again. data
say limited number studies showing ingesting glutamine anywhere
one three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now,
mechanism still isn't clear whether not adjusting pH whether not
creating favorable environment microbiota, clear supplementing
glutamine can, people enhance say improve conditions
leaky gut, might useful well.

01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin

final thing this, want talk talking chemical
sensing gut impacts wellbeing gut acidity, confess
little bit controversial. people board, people not.
love feedback this, you, agree, please tell disagree, please
tell me, please tell disagree particular, experience data, although
always better can point towards peer reviewed studies. practice
people embrace. not recommending people necessarily this.


definitely want talk doctor, people food allergies
mood auto-immune issues, treat this, people
recommend treating ingestion HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now
hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, literally can melt away
skin. want careful acids kinds, truly, hydrochloric acid
sold supplement form capsule pill form. practice starting
ingest one two hydrochloric acid tablets midway meal people
will generally examine see whether not improves symptoms
indigestion, relates mood, relates well-being, relates
sensation gut viscera. changing acidity, also changed way
gut communicates brain mechanisms talked before.
growing number people embracing practices taking HCL.
often combined things, usually combined enzyme enzyme
pepsin. supplements come form betaine HCL pepsin
not cure-all, certainly don't want suggest cure-all, many
people hard time adjusting pH gut hard time adjusting
microbiota gut appropriate ways benefited taking
betaine HCL pepsin tablets capsules meals. general instruction
start slow, start one two, find level comfortable
doesn't create excessive feeling warmth stomach, doesn't throw off

don't, might one avenue pursue. However think primary
fermented food findings, not just one study, many many findings now
bring us place huge center massive data pointing us direction

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing
neurogenesis, least no data support it, can't make new
neurons, also can't damage ones got, shouldn't much
possible. blood brain barrier BBB. BBB
called prevents substances getting brain, however, like fence, not
always uniform along length. little spots within fence
chemicals can sneak across brain beautiful design, don't know
anything design. always say, wasn't consulted design phase. not
talking kind intelligent design anything not topic
podcast. not philosophy podcast, religion podcast, science
podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens
acidic, neurons area postrema neurons chemo receptor trigger zone,
CTZ called, trigger bunch motor reflexes abdominal wall make
barf. Okay, feeling need throw triggered neurons
brain stem. neurons brainstem triggered presence certain
chemicals. reason don't blood brain barrier location
post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-
trauma cause vomiting. example, whereby memories, context, also
just chemistry internal state triggering behaviors hardwired.
reflux driven. people get nauseous
others given level, well, alcohol tolerance. people
called a, know, refer stronger stomach stomach steel.
people throw easily don't feel well, ingest anything
just little bit off. purely adaptive standpoint, probably better vomit


things aren't good rather pass system.
Especially things contained lipids. instance ingest something
liquid form cells, literally every cell body surrounded little
thin layer fatty tissue, call bilayer membrane, little membrane. Fat can
move fat easily. bad stuff ingest can get stuck
system.

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,
front, called ventricles, start called lateral ventricles
excuse me, starts third lateral ventricles, goes
fourth ventricle called central canal. basically just big
space middle nervous system middle brain.


one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal
fluid fills ventricle. words, neurons sensing
chemistry cerebral spinal fluid, access therefore chemistry
body. cerebral spinal fluid going brain spinal
cord. cerebral spinal fluid signals various chemicals within
body. not mechanical system. chemical system. Remember
talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing
there. course, locally, will effects, little things called mast cell. M-A-
S-T little packets histamine literally will go explode [poofs] cause
inflammation, actually good inflammation. release little things called
macrophages gobble infection. day, Texas,
mean little mosquitoes Texas, lot them, stand outside get
bitten, didn't feel thing, later night, started swelling itching
itch them, swell even more.
release mass cells, histamines inside mass cells literally causing
inflammation tissue. wasn't poison mosquito itself.
immune response those. Well, also systemic body-wide attempt kill
stuff, fever. neurons ventricles cerebral spinal fluid
go particular name, called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum,
ventricular near ventricles. organs set
neurons, really cool name called OVLT. don't know like that, just
like it, organum vasculosum lateral terminalis organum vasculosum
lateral terminalis, OVLT neurons respond toxins bad stuff
bloodstream, however minor major. release things like ILK-1,
inflammatory cytokines inflammatory case good, want inflammation
site infection. good thing. going help healing. going
change conditions body, going happen OVLT
neurons activated, something bad body something bad
happening body, communicate area brain called


preoptic area hypothalamus preoptic area cranks temperature
tries cook bad thing. Now worth talking fever moment
talking thermal regulation, think actually save lives.
overheated point where, know, getting past 102 103,
going vary depending person person certainly age, know, kids,
people think can tolerate higher levels fever adults, look, always want
cautious heating brain much, neurons
gone, not come back neurons not well high temperatures.
body temperature starts getting 102, 103, certainly 104, starting
enter serious danger zone. can happen exercise hot environments
inability escape heat don't covering adequate ventilation
cooling. can also excessive fever,

01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling Blood Properly

whatever reason. lot people think way deal put cool
compress back neck cool torso. discussing
colleague, Craig Heller Stanford School Medicine,
undergraduate side campus well, runs biology lab. world expert
thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic
area, will heat can cook brain organs further.
want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism
OVLT,

01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress

sensing chemistry OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis that. talked sensing lung volume, speed heartbeat,
talked sensing gut volume, intestinal volume, absence
volume. talked chemistry gut gut microbiota auto immune
functions. now talked vomiting, talked fever, lots
aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter
chemistry gut ways vagus nerve quiets
neurons communicate gut brain. want say again, stress will disrupt
gut make feel not good, poor digestion, just lousy, way
shuts vagus nerve neurons gut. stress


blocks communication gut brain, doesn't mess gut. just
doesn't let gut get signals brain, also throws off
chemistry. whole cascade effects. want learn
stress, whole episode called "Master Stress," think maybe called
"Conquer Stress" "Master Stress," either one. whole point episode
give tools practices deal short term, acute stress, moderate term
stress, long-term chronic stress behavioral mechanisms,

01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions

nutrition, supplementation, many things well. chockablock full
protocols tools stress. vagus nerve, however, responsible emotion
way pool, aggregate conditions gut, conditions
heart conditions breathing, includes diaphragm
lungs takes kind collection information sends brain
controls call emotions. Now might seem obvious people,
people might seem totally crazy. thought emotions
market invested, something thought
going happen not going happen, thought school open
not, maybe thought wasn't, whatever bothers you,
think generally purely cognitive event. brain doesn't really know
information. doesn't act directly information create moods.
Moods created heart's response reading headline, change
breathing, caused someone love telling actually
not interested spending time anymore, screwed
interested spending lot time like that, right? Emotions can
good bad neutral. thing call interoception, sense self
building fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune
systems, auto-immune might've thinking, wait, thought going
sense self, noticing feeling. indeed things
plugging like series ingredients recipe gives rise mood
feel, mood feel shown one location body
people can see. facial expressions. indeed now
beautiful data showing face, including size pupils, tonality

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking

people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something

neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-
trauma cause vomiting. example, whereby memories, context, also
just chemistry internal state triggering behaviors hardwired.
reflux driven. people get nauseous
others given level, well, alcohol tolerance. people
called a, know, refer stronger stomach stomach steel.
people throw easily don't feel well, ingest anything
just little bit off. purely adaptive standpoint, probably better vomit


things aren't good rather pass system.
Especially things contained lipids. instance ingest something
liquid form cells, literally every cell body surrounded little
thin layer fatty tissue, call bilayer membrane, little membrane. Fat can
move fat easily. bad stuff ingest can get stuck
system.

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,
front, called ventricles, start called lateral ventricles
excuse me, starts third lateral ventricles, goes
fourth ventricle called central canal. basically just big
space middle nervous system middle brain.


one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal
fluid fills ventricle. words, neurons sensing
chemistry cerebral spinal fluid, access therefore chemistry
body. cerebral spinal fluid going brain spinal
cord. cerebral spinal fluid signals various chemicals within
body. not mechanical system. chemical system. Remember
talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing
there. course, locally, will effects, little things called mast cell. M-A-
S-T little packets histamine literally will go explode [poofs] cause
inflammation, actually good inflammation. release little things called
macrophages gobble infection. day, Texas,
mean little mosquitoes Texas, lot them, stand outside get
bitten, didn't feel thing, later night, started swelling itching
itch them, swell even more.
release mass cells, histamines inside mass cells literally causing
inflammation tissue. wasn't poison mosquito itself.
immune response those. Well, also systemic body-wide attempt kill
stuff, fever. neurons ventricles cerebral spinal fluid
go particular name, called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum,
ventricular near ventricles. organs set
neurons, really cool name called OVLT. don't know like that, just
like it, organum vasculosum lateral terminalis organum vasculosum
lateral terminalis, OVLT neurons respond toxins bad stuff
bloodstream, however minor major. release things like ILK-1,
inflammatory cytokines inflammatory case good, want inflammation
site infection. good thing. going help healing. going
change conditions body, going happen OVLT
neurons activated, something bad body something bad
happening body, communicate area brain called


preoptic area hypothalamus preoptic area cranks temperature
tries cook bad thing. Now worth talking fever moment
talking thermal regulation, think actually save lives.
overheated point where, know, getting past 102 103,
going vary depending person person certainly age, know, kids,
people think can tolerate higher levels fever adults, look, always want
cautious heating brain much, neurons
gone, not come back neurons not well high temperatures.
body temperature starts getting 102, 103, certainly 104, starting
enter serious danger zone. can happen exercise hot environments
inability escape heat don't covering adequate ventilation
cooling. can also excessive fever,

01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling Blood Properly

whatever reason. lot people think way deal put cool
compress back neck cool torso. discussing
colleague, Craig Heller Stanford School Medicine,
undergraduate side campus well, runs biology lab. world expert
thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic
area, will heat can cook brain organs further.
want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism
OVLT,

01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress

sensing chemistry OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis that. talked sensing lung volume, speed heartbeat,
talked sensing gut volume, intestinal volume, absence
volume. talked chemistry gut gut microbiota auto immune
functions. now talked vomiting, talked fever, lots
aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter
chemistry gut ways vagus nerve quiets
neurons communicate gut brain. want say again, stress will disrupt
gut make feel not good, poor digestion, just lousy, way
shuts vagus nerve neurons gut. stress


blocks communication gut brain, doesn't mess gut. just
doesn't let gut get signals brain, also throws off
chemistry. whole cascade effects. want learn

people might seem totally crazy. thought emotions
market invested, something thought
going happen not going happen, thought school open
not, maybe thought wasn't, whatever bothers you,
think generally purely cognitive event. brain doesn't really know

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked

seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions

want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body

Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak

Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will

hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going
vagus. don't really like term. interoceptive awareness.
again, many studies now showing sake bettering one's mood
overall, sake moving challenging phase life, sake just enhancing
one's experience life overall, whether not taste foods, interactions
people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning one's interoceptive awareness
easy just taking minute two trying count heartbeats.
works best, course, independent readout heartbeats
can compare, can see accurate are, even don't use device
device that, without taking pulse, using thumb wrist
something, fingers neck, typically taking pulse,
trying sit still minute two every while, maybe week, maybe
twice week, maybe meditating, maybe breathwork, maybe
breath holds breathwork, don't really kind extended


way, can quickly increase interoceptive tone. huge
outsized effect brain, body relationship brain's ability tap
subconscious conscious aspects chemical mechanical signaling
happening time. can real out-sized positive effects
ability engage people ability focus work ability
notice, ah, finding kind feeling like losing focus, really
heart rate just increasing. Maybe just exhale little bit bring heart rate
down. whatever effectually tried today give window
incredible relationship viscera brain brain
viscera, organs body, hope appreciate
system, aren't just system tubes. said sort jest, mean,
lot tubes system tubes, system tubes linked

01:21:45 Nausea: Happens Brain; Area Postrema

stomach slightly acid one might think want to. talk
barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, contents guts run
reverse, meaning go stomach. Sometimes even
intestines, even though sounds horrible, sometimes happens up,
esophagus mouth onto whatever surface happens front you.
terrible thing, nobody likes it, interesting aspect biology
reveals beautiful absolutely fundamental relationship
chemistry brain. brain actually locked behind gate gate
not skull. gate so-called blood-brain barrier. just like gut
epithelial tight junctions, things talked provide fence,
things can't get get leaky gut, brain tight junctions
tight. absolutely fundamental certain molecules get across
blood brain barrier others don't. reason
99.99999% neurons not regenerate, don't care read, especially
news recently psychedelics cause neurogenesis, don't,
absolutely wrong. Psychedelics effects brain plasticity, nothing
neurogenesis, least no data support it, can't make new
neurons, also can't damage ones got, shouldn't much
possible. blood brain barrier BBB. BBB
called prevents substances getting brain, however, like fence, not
always uniform along length. little spots within fence
chemicals can sneak across brain beautiful design, don't know
anything design. always say, wasn't consulted design phase. not
talking kind intelligent design anything not topic
podcast. not philosophy podcast, religion podcast, science
podcast, beautiful design sort, little holes fence.
little neurons sit right behind holes neurons sense
chemistry blood is. guessing probably didn't imagine today's
discussion sensing self sensing blood, do.
little area brain, little indeed, important called area postrema
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. area postrema area brainstem sits right next
another brain area called chemo receptor trigger zone. contents


bloodstream particular kind, meaning pathogens
acidic, neurons area postrema neurons chemo receptor trigger zone,
CTZ called, trigger bunch motor reflexes abdominal wall make
barf. Okay, feeling need throw triggered neurons
brain stem. neurons brainstem triggered presence certain
chemicals. reason don't blood brain barrier location
post-trauma like crossing guard, making sure everything
coming blood okay, even senses just tiniest bit,
things off, going trigger reflex. Now, really interesting thing
neurons area postrema respond chemistry blood, also will
respond consciousness, things think things believe
even particular memories. certain people see vomit see someone
else vomit, even somebody else heaving, going vomit,
feel going vomit. guessing probably even right
now feel like might vomit. might feel salivation throat,
always precursor vomiting. people, memory of, thought
something like blood vomit or, use imagination, can actually trigger vomit
reflex. neurons area sensitive prior experience
interactions negative things. actually, saying this, feel gut kind
cramping again, not, don't vomit easily, not one those,
somebody never vomited. talking vomit history,
think appropriate this, context, neurons area, basically
keep whole system safe thank goodness are, instance,
people, unfortunately, drink much alcohol throw up. ever
wondered is? Well alcohol fundamentally poison. not
saying for, know, age appropriate folks ingesting alcohol bad. isn't
judgment call, alcohol excessive levels bloodstream triggers post-
trauma cause vomiting. example, whereby memories, context, also
just chemistry internal state triggering behaviors hardwired.
reflux driven. people get nauseous
others given level, well, alcohol tolerance. people
called a, know, refer stronger stomach stomach steel.
people throw easily don't feel well, ingest anything
just little bit off. purely adaptive standpoint, probably better vomit


things aren't good rather pass system.
Especially things contained lipids. instance ingest something
liquid form cells, literally every cell body surrounded little
thin layer fatty tissue, call bilayer membrane, little membrane. Fat can
move fat easily. bad stuff ingest can get stuck
system.

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,
front, called ventricles, start called lateral ventricles
excuse me, starts third lateral ventricles, goes
fourth ventricle called central canal. basically just big
space middle nervous system middle brain.


one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal
fluid fills ventricle. words, neurons sensing
chemistry cerebral spinal fluid, access therefore chemistry
body. cerebral spinal fluid going brain spinal
cord. cerebral spinal fluid signals various chemicals within
body. not mechanical system. chemical system. Remember
talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing
there. course, locally, will effects, little things called mast cell. M-A-
S-T little packets histamine literally will go explode [poofs] cause
inflammation, actually good inflammation. release little things called
macrophages gobble infection. day, Texas,
mean little mosquitoes Texas, lot them, stand outside get
bitten, didn't feel thing, later night, started swelling itching
itch them, swell even more.
release mass cells, histamines inside mass cells literally causing
inflammation tissue. wasn't poison mosquito itself.
immune response those. Well, also systemic body-wide attempt kill
stuff, fever. neurons ventricles cerebral spinal fluid
go particular name, called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum,
ventricular near ventricles. organs set
neurons, really cool name called OVLT. don't know like that, just
like it, organum vasculosum lateral terminalis organum vasculosum
lateral terminalis, OVLT neurons respond toxins bad stuff
bloodstream, however minor major. release things like ILK-1,
inflammatory cytokines inflammatory case good, want inflammation
site infection. good thing. going help healing. going
change conditions body, going happen OVLT
neurons activated, something bad body something bad
happening body, communicate area brain called


preoptic area hypothalamus preoptic area cranks temperature
tries cook bad thing. Now worth talking fever moment
talking thermal regulation, think actually save lives.
overheated point where, know, getting past 102 103,
going vary depending person person certainly age, know, kids,
people think can tolerate higher levels fever adults, look, always want
cautious heating brain much, neurons
gone, not come back neurons not well high temperatures.
body temperature starts getting 102, 103, certainly 104, starting
enter serious danger zone. can happen exercise hot environments
inability escape heat don't covering adequate ventilation
cooling. can also excessive fever,

01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling Blood Properly

whatever reason. lot people think way deal put cool
compress back neck cool torso. discussing
colleague, Craig Heller Stanford School Medicine,
undergraduate side campus well, runs biology lab. world expert
thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic
area, will heat can cook brain organs further.
want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism
OVLT,

01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress

sensing chemistry OVLT, organum vasculosum lateral
terminalis that. talked sensing lung volume, speed heartbeat,
talked sensing gut volume, intestinal volume, absence
volume. talked chemistry gut gut microbiota auto immune
functions. now talked vomiting, talked fever, lots
aspects sensing internal self. Now want turn attention interoception
relates feelings, way interoception commonly described. want
highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved
till now, rather mentioning along highlight specific point,
whenever hear vagus popular culture, like vagus calms
down, want stimulate vagus rubbing front ear,
parasympathetic nerve, will calm down, mellow out. Actually,
time, vagus stimulatory. ingest foods amino acids, sugars,
fatty acids, vagus nerve gets activated triggers release dopamine,
makes alert go seek foods led conditions.
feel nauseous rarely calming, feel like fever,
rarely calming. starting get picture even though vagus nerve
parasympathetic branch autonomic nervous system. doesn't
mean anything you, not aficionado, don't worry it. not
calming system, communication system, motor system.
communicates brain body body brain, changes function different
organs, now, one thing important highlight stress will alter
chemistry gut ways vagus nerve quiets
neurons communicate gut brain. want say again, stress will disrupt
gut make feel not good, poor digestion, just lousy, way
shuts vagus nerve neurons gut. stress


blocks communication gut brain, doesn't mess gut. just
doesn't let gut get signals brain, also throws off
chemistry. whole cascade effects. want learn
stress, whole episode called "Master Stress," think maybe called
"Conquer Stress" "Master Stress," either one. whole point episode
give tools practices deal short term, acute stress, moderate term
stress, long-term chronic stress behavioral mechanisms,

01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions

nutrition, supplementation, many things well. chockablock full
protocols tools stress. vagus nerve, however, responsible emotion
way pool, aggregate conditions gut, conditions
heart conditions breathing, includes diaphragm
lungs takes kind collection information sends brain
controls call emotions. Now might seem obvious people,
people might seem totally crazy. thought emotions
market invested, something thought
going happen not going happen, thought school open
not, maybe thought wasn't, whatever bothers you,
think generally purely cognitive event. brain doesn't really know
information. doesn't act directly information create moods.
Moods created heart's response reading headline, change
breathing, caused someone love telling actually
not interested spending time anymore, screwed
interested spending lot time like that, right? Emotions can
good bad neutral. thing call interoception, sense self
building fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune
systems, auto-immune might've thinking, wait, thought going
sense self, noticing feeling. indeed things
plugging like series ingredients recipe gives rise mood
feel, mood feel shown one location body
people can see. facial expressions. indeed now
beautiful data showing face, including size pupils, tonality


face, flushed are, pale are, even degree
frowning smiling relative periods time, aggregate of,

Trojan horse purpose talk vagus
hear, oh, know, can get vagal tone breathing rubbing front
short probably true, another fundamental layer acidity gut,
fast breathing inhale-emphasized, exhale-emphasized breathing.
relaxed pupils tend constrict. alert, pupils
tend dilated, whether not alertness happy sad.

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity

good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking

01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.

talk second reduce nausea, nausea
salivation, feeling going vomit, can beneficial an,
adaptive circumstance. Like ingested something bad, people
experience nausea, reasons, good ways regulate nausea
ways regulate nausea, interesting. actually adjust activity
neurons area postrema change chemistry blood directly. many
heard before, perhaps, turns good data, 11
research studies ones find peer reviewed research studies no
bias, independent studies showing ginger can cause notable reduction
nausea, much ginger, one three grams, one three grams
measure scale, unless taking pill capsule form. doesn't
seem matter take pill capsule form, thing heard
ginger can reduce nausea, indeed true. Peppermint, apparently can also that.
will not surprised learn cannabis can reduce nausea, not
surprise cannabis, different legality different places,
understand that, please take consideration. cannabis, THC and,
turns CBD can reduce nausea, shown least one study.
probably that, not changing chemistry blood, changing
threshold firing neurons area post-trauma. conditions
chemotherapy radiation therapy others people feeling
nauseous, not recommending people go use cannabis, unless decided
selves family doctor should. interesting
thing CBD whole episode THC CBD doesn't have,
isn't supposed psychoactive properties THC does. Although CBD can
mild major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, appear data


data support. say, anecdotal reports, cannabis
can reduce nausea.

01:30:40 Fever: Triggers Control Knobs: OVLT

barf less, ginger, peppermint, appropriate legal you, possibly
cannabis. Now talk fever. previous episodes, future episodes,
deal thermal regulation, body's ability regulate temperature. Talk
cold heat saunas ice baths physical performance. not
going deal right now, promise will going forward. Today,
want talk fever fever directly relates interoception. mean
that? Well, fever simply increase body temperature, increase body
temperature triggered neurons brain. neurons brain
triggered presence particular things bloodstream. sorts things?
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, something bad gets system, body doesn't
know bad, just knows foreign, hasn't seen before.
wrong compartment body. earlier talking proteins leak
gut get elsewhere, know, don't want piece steak sitting
bicep. bad, actually develop antibodies,
horrible infection. body intelligence, intelligence know,
Hmm, proteins normally not seen region body cells
there, say, release something will travel brain will
trigger increase body temperature body cooks bad thing
cause bad thing. really beautiful adaptive mechanism. always think fever
terrible, fever cook bad thing inside you, left
correct compartment inside wrong compartment inside you.
beautiful fever mechanism looks lot like barfing mechanism.
Basically set neurons sit near ventricles, remember ventrals
hole tube, you, tube is, tube, series tubes.
brain hole middle. extends bottom spinal cord,
front, called ventricles, start called lateral ventricles
excuse me, starts third lateral ventricles, goes
fourth ventricle called central canal. basically just big
space middle nervous system middle brain.


one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal
fluid fills ventricle. words, neurons sensing
chemistry cerebral spinal fluid, access therefore chemistry
body. cerebral spinal fluid going brain spinal
cord. cerebral spinal fluid signals various chemicals within
body. not mechanical system. chemical system. Remember
talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing
there. course, locally, will effects, little things called mast cell. M-A-
S-T little packets histamine literally will go explode [poofs] cause
inflammation, actually good inflammation. release little things called
macrophages gobble infection. day, Texas,
mean little mosquitoes Texas, lot them, stand outside get
bitten, didn't feel thing, later night, started swelling itching
itch them, swell even more.
release mass cells, histamines inside mass cells literally causing
inflammation tissue. wasn't poison mosquito itself.
immune response those. Well, also systemic body-wide attempt kill
stuff, fever. neurons ventricles cerebral spinal fluid
go particular name, called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum,
ventricular near ventricles. organs set
neurons, really cool name called OVLT. don't know like that, just
like it, organum vasculosum lateral terminalis organum vasculosum
lateral terminalis, OVLT neurons respond toxins bad stuff
bloodstream, however minor major. release things like ILK-1,
inflammatory cytokines inflammatory case good, want inflammation
site infection. good thing. going help healing. going
change conditions body, going happen OVLT
neurons activated, something bad body something bad
happening body, communicate area brain called


preoptic area hypothalamus preoptic area cranks temperature
tries cook bad thing. Now worth talking fever moment
talking thermal regulation, think actually save lives.
overheated point where, know, getting past 102 103,
going vary depending person person certainly age, know, kids,
people think can tolerate higher levels fever adults, look, always want
cautious heating brain much, neurons
gone, not come back neurons not well high temperatures.
body temperature starts getting 102, 103, certainly 104, starting
enter serious danger zone. can happen exercise hot environments
inability escape heat don't covering adequate ventilation
cooling. can also excessive fever,

01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling Blood Properly

whatever reason. lot people think way deal put cool
compress back neck cool torso. discussing
colleague, Craig Heller Stanford School Medicine,
undergraduate side campus well, runs biology lab. world expert
thermal regulation. clear wrong response try cool off
body. put cold towel put ice pack back neck,
effectively cool blood going brain. that,
brain will react turning crank speak neurons pre optic
area, will heat can cook brain organs further.
want is, talked before, want cool bottoms feet,
palms hands upper part face. not going go
details want right now, locations want
cool. Now can also cool rest body, not okay just stay
covers just cool, know, neck something like that. really want try
create systemic whole body cooling, goal bring fever down,
many cases, fever adaptive. taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like
Advil Tylenol sometimes can good, recommended, times,
reduces fever, allowing pathogen, pyrogen, sometimes
called, pyrogen substance causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think


pyromaniacs, think pyro, pyrogens can survive moderate low temperatures,
can't survive high temperatures. fever adaptive mechanism

one ventricle already mentioned called third ventricle. shaped kind
like thin oval upright, listening this, just think I, shape I,
kind rotated 90 degrees. opposed across. along
third ventricle, little neurons can sense cerebral spinal
fluid fills ventricle. words, neurons sensing
chemistry cerebral spinal fluid, access therefore chemistry
body. cerebral spinal fluid going brain spinal

body. not mechanical system. chemical system. Remember
talking mechanical information chemical information accessing brain.
something bad system, ingested a, breathe virus
inhaled bacteria, got cut leg bacteria growing
there. course, locally, will effects, little things called mast cell. M-A-
S-T little packets histamine literally will go explode [poofs] cause
inflammation, actually good inflammation. release little things called
macrophages gobble infection. day, Texas,

highlight term many probably heard, vagus nerve.
talked vagus little bit earlier, vagus nerve, vagabonding wandering
nerve involved everything talked now. reason saved

people might seem totally crazy. thought emotions
market invested, something thought
going happen not going happen, thought school open
not, maybe thought wasn't, whatever bothers you,
think generally purely cognitive event. brain doesn't really know

Moods created heart's response reading headline, change

01:45:00 Sensing People’s Emotions via Body

remarkable, interoception really takes leap
incredible beautiful studies show instance, know
somebody pretty well going sort experience kind,
heart rate actually starts mimic heart rate. breathing starts mimic
breathing, even aren't conscious breathing. not like see chest
heaving, think, oh goodness, breathe way.
mirroring no not carried mirror neurons. Mirror neurons
myth reality, sorry burst people's bubbles. bubble around mirror
neurons definitely made myths topic another time, start mirror.
Somehow human beings able register internal state beings,
think probably animals too, certainly humans, even distance.
studies many now, really wonderful studies.

01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat

sense internal landscape linked others. Now can enhance
interoceptive capacity feel others feel, words, can
start getting better readout internal state simple exercise,
really tool. learn sense heartbeats. people
good this, people not, people can easily
air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
exteroceptive information outside world, closing eyes focusing
inward, say, start paying attention breathing cadence, start
directing mind's attention heart rate, can start perceive
heart beating. actually quickly strengthen vagal connections
body brain. no real practice here. no breathe way
thing except direct awareness toward heartbeat.
people can get good fast. people find just
minute so, every while, start tap sixth sense. start
notice don't feel quite right something somebody situation,
start notice feel quite right somebody something
situation. interoceptive awareness can tuned up. used called vagal
tone, think term doesn't take account things going

air exhaled people can better holding breath


hold. one thing kind cool whole interoceptive capacity
can enhance quickly. can learn teach heightened levels
interoception way can't really just give heightened levels vision
snapping fingers, one one tool exercise, things can
improve vision. topic previous episode. encourage look up.
things can improve hearing taste smell,
talked those, interoception can get good fast.
think one reasons meditation powerful. Think lot
reasons meditation powerful, one reasons stop taking
